<h2>PREFACE.</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>In presenting this volume to the public, I feel that a few words
of explanation are due to the readers that it may obtain, in addition
to those offered to them in the first chapter.&nbsp; When I first visited
England, in 1846, it was my intention to make a pedestrian tour from
one end of the island to the other, in order to become more acquainted
with the country and people than I could by any other mode of travelling.&nbsp;
A few weeks after my arrival, I set out on such a walk, and had made
about one hundred miles on foot, when I was constrained to suspend the
tour, in order to take part in movements which soon absorbed all my
time and strength.&nbsp; For the ensuing ten years I was nearly the
whole time in Great Britain, travelling from one end of the kingdom
to the other, to promote the movements referred to; still desiring to
accomplish the walk originally proposed.&nbsp; On returning to England
at the beginning of 1863, after a continuous residence of seven years
in America, I found myself, for the first time, in the condition to
carry out my intention of 1846.&nbsp; Several new motives had been added
in the interval to those that had at first operated upon my mind.&nbsp;
I had dabbled a little in farming in my native village, New Britain,
Connecticut, and had labored to excite additional interest in agriculture
among my neighbors.&nbsp; We had formed an Agricultural Club, and met
weekly for several winters to compare notes, exchange opinions&rsquo;
and discuss matters connected with the occupation.&nbsp; They had honored
me with the post of Corresponding Secretary from the beginning.&nbsp;
We held a meeting the evening before I left for England, when they not
only refused to accept my resignation as Secretary, but made me promise
to write them letters about farming in the Mother Country, and on other
matters of interest that I might meet with on my travels there.&nbsp;
My first idea was to do this literally;&mdash;to make a walk through
the best agricultural sections of England, and write home a series of
communications to be inserted in our little village paper.&nbsp; But,
on second thought, on considering the size of the sheet, I found it
would require four or five years to print in it all I was likely to
write, at the rate of two columns a week.&nbsp; So I concluded that
the easiest and quickest way would be to make a book of my Notes by
the Way, and to send back to my old friends and neighbors in that form
all the observations and incidents I might make and meet on my walk.&nbsp;
The next thought that suggested itself was this,&mdash;that a good many
persons in Great Britain might feel some interest in seeing what an
American, who had resided so long in this country, might have to say
of its sceneries, industries, social life, etc.&nbsp; Still, in writing
out these Notes, although two distinct circles of readers&mdash;the
English and American&mdash;have been present to my mind, I felt constrained
to face and address the latter, just as if speaking to them alone.&nbsp;
I have, moreover, adopted the free and easy style of epistolary composition,
endeavoring to make each chapter as much like one of the letters I promised
my friends and neighbors at home as practicable.&nbsp; In doing this,
the &ldquo;<i>I</i>&rdquo; has, perhaps, talked far too much to beseem
those proprieties which the author of a book should observe.&nbsp; Besides,
expressions, figures and orthography more American than English may
be noticed, which will indicate the circle of readers which the writer
had primarily in view.&nbsp; Still, he would fain believe that these
features of the volume will not seriously affect the interest it might
otherwise possess in the minds of those disposed to give it a reading
in this country.&nbsp; Whatever exceptions they may take to the style
and diction, I hope they will find none to the spirit of the work.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ELIHU

<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p><i>MOTIVES TO THE WALK&mdash;THE IRON HORSE AND HIS RIDER&mdash;THE
LOSSES AND GAINS BY SPEED&mdash;THE RAILWAY TRACK AND TURNPIKE ROAD:
THEIR SCENERIES COMPARED.</i></p>
<p>One of my motives for making this tour was to look at the country
towns and villages on the way in the face and eyes; to enter them by
the front door, and to see them as they were made to be seen first,
as far as man&rsquo;s mind and hand intended and wrought.&nbsp; Railway
travelling, as yet, takes everything at a disadvantage; it does not
front on nature, or art, or the common conditions and industries of
men in town or country.&nbsp; If it does not actually of itself turn,
it presents everything the wrong side outward.&nbsp; In cities, it reveals
the ragged and smutty companionship of tumble-down out-houses, and mysteries
of cellar and back-kitchen life which were never intended for other
eyes than those that grope in them by day or night.&nbsp; How unnatural,
and, more, almost profane and inhuman, is the fiery locomotion of the
Iron Horse through these densely-peopled towns! now the screech, the
roar, and the darkness of cavernous passages under paved streets, church
vaults, and an acre or two of three-story brick houses, with the feeling
of a world of breathing, bustling humanity incumbent upon you;&mdash;now
the dash and flash out into the light, and the higgledy-piggledy glimpses
of the next five minutes.&nbsp; In a moment you are above thickly-thronged
streets, and the houses on either side, looking down into the black
throats of smoky chimneys; into the garret lairs of poverty, sickness,
and sin; down lower upon squads of children trying to play in back-yards
eight feet square.&nbsp; It is all wrong, except in the single quality
of speed.&nbsp; You enter the town as you would a farmer&rsquo;s house,
if you first passed through the pig-stye into the kitchen.&nbsp; Every
respectable house in the city turns its back upon you; and often a very
brick and dirty back too, though it may show an elegant front of Bath
or Portland stone to the street it faces.&nbsp; All the respectable
streets run over or under you with an audible shudder of disgust or
dread.&nbsp; None but a shabby lane of low shops for the sale of junk,
beer, onions, shrimps, and cabbages, will run a third of a mile by your
side for the sake of your company.&nbsp; The wickedest boys in the town
hoot at you, with most ignominious and satiric antics, as you pass;
and if they do not shie stones in upon you, or dead cats, it is more
from fear of the beadle or the constable than out of respect for your
business or pleasure.</p>
<p>Indeed, every town and village, great or small, which you pass through
or near on the railway, looks as if you came fifty years before you
were expected.&nbsp; It says, in all the legible expressions of its
countenance, &ldquo;Lack-a-day!&mdash;if here isn&rsquo;t that creature
come already, and looking in at my back door before I had time to turn
around, or put anything in shape!&rdquo;&nbsp; The Iron Horse himself
gets no sympathy nor humane admiration.&nbsp; He stands grim and wrathy,
when reined up for two minutes and forty-five seconds at a station.&nbsp;
No venturesome boys pat him on the flanks, or look kindly into his eyes,
or say a pleasant word to him, or even wonder if he is tired, or thirsty,
or hungry.&nbsp; None of the ostlers of the greasy stables, in which
the locomotives are housed, ever call him Dobbin, or Old Jack, or Jenny,
or say, &ldquo;Well done, old fellow!&rdquo; when they unhitch him from
the train at midnight, after a journey of a hundred leagues.&nbsp; His
driver is a real man of flesh and blood; with wife and children whom
he loves.&nbsp; He goes on Sunday to church, and, maybe, sings the psalms
of David, and listens devoutly to the sermon, and says prayers at home,
and the few who know him speak well of him, as a good and proper man
in his way.&nbsp; But, spurred and mounted upon the saddle of the great
iron hexiped, nearly all the passengers regard him as a part of the
beast.&nbsp; No one speaks to him, or thinks of him on the journey.&nbsp;
He may pull up at fifty stations, and not a soul among the Firsts, Seconds,
or even Thirds, will offer him a glass of beer, or pipe-full of tobacco,
or give him a sixpence at the end of the ride for extra speed or care.&nbsp;
His face is grimy, and greasy, and black.&nbsp; All his motions are
ambiguous and awkward to the casual observer.&nbsp; He has none of the
sedate and conscious dignity of his predecessor on the old stage-coach
box.&nbsp; He handles no whip, like him, with easy grace.&nbsp; Indeed,
in putting up his great beast to its best speed, he &ldquo;hides his
whip in the manger,&rdquo; according to a proverb older than steam power.&nbsp;
He wears no gloves in the coldest weather; not always a coat, and never
a decent one, at his work.&nbsp; He blows no cheery music out of a brass
bugle as he approaches a town, but pricks the loins of the fiery beast,
and makes him scream with a sound between a human whistle and an alligator&rsquo;s
croak.&nbsp; He never pulls up abreast of the station-house door, in
the fashion of the old coach driver, to show off himself and his leaders,
but runs on several rods ahead of his passengers and spectators, as
if to be clear of them and their comments, good or bad.&nbsp; At the
end of the journey, be it at midnight or day-break, not a man nor a
woman he has driven safely at the rate of forty miles an hour thinks
or cares what becomes of him, or separates him in thought from the great
iron monster he mounts.&nbsp; Not the smock-frocked man, getting out
of the forwardmost Third, with his stick and bundle, thinks of him,
or stops a moment to see him back out and turn into the stable.</p>
<p>With all the practical advantages of this machine propulsion at bird
speed over space, it confounds and swallows up the poetical aspects
and picturesque sceneries that were the charm of old-fashioned travelling
in the country.&nbsp; The most beautiful landscapes rotate around a
locomotive axis confusedly.&nbsp; Green pastures and yellow wheat fields
are in a whirl.&nbsp; Tall and venerable trees get into the wake of
the same motion, and the large, pied cows ruminating in their shade,
seem to lie on the revolving arc of an indefinite circle.&nbsp; The
views dissolve before their best aspect is caught by the eye.&nbsp;
The flowers, like Eastern beauties, can only be seen &ldquo;half hidden
and half revealed,&rdquo; in the general unsteadiness.&nbsp; As for
bees, you cannot hear or see them at all; and the songs of the happiest
birds are drowned altogether by the clatter of a hundred wheels on the
metal track.&nbsp; If there are any poor, flat, or fen lands, your way
is sure to lie through them.&nbsp; In a picturesque and undulating country,
studded with parks and mansions of wealth and taste, you are plunging
through a long, dark tunnel, or walled into a deep cut, before your
eye can catch the view that dashes by your carriage window.&nbsp; If
you have a utilitarian proclivity and purpose, and would like to see
the great agricultural industries of the country, they present themselves
to you in as confused aspects as the sceneries of the passing landscape.&nbsp;
The face of every farm is turned from you.&nbsp; The farmer&rsquo;s
house fronts on the turnpike road, and the best views of his homestead,
of his industry, prosperity, and happiness, look that way.&nbsp; You
only get a furtive glance, a kind of clandestine and diagonal peep at
him and his doings; and having thus travelled a hundred miles through
a fertile country you can form no approximate or satisfactory idea of
its character and productions.</p>
<p>But no facts nor arguments are needed to convince an intelligent
traveller that the railway affords no point of view for seeing town
or country to any satisfactory perception of its character.&nbsp; Indeed,
neither coach of the olden, nor cab of the modern vogue, nor saddle,
will enable one to &ldquo;do&rdquo; either town or country with thorough
insight and enjoyment.&nbsp; It takes him too long to pull up to catch
the features of a sudden view.&nbsp; He can do nothing with those generous
and delightful institutions of Old England,&mdash;the footpaths, that
thread pasture, park, and field, seemingly permeating her whole green
world with dusky veins for the circulation of human life.&nbsp; To lose
all the picturesque lanes and landscapes which these field-paths cross
and command, is to lose the great distinctive charm of the country.&nbsp;
Then, neither from the coach-box nor the saddle can he make much conversation
on the way.&nbsp; He loses the chance of a thousand little talks and
pleasant incidents.&nbsp; He cannot say &ldquo;Good morning&rdquo; to
the farmer at the stile, nor a word of greeting to the reapers over
the hedge, nor see where they live, and the kind of children that play
by their cottage doors; nor the little, antique churches, bearded to
their eye-brows with ivy, covering the wrinkles of half a dozen centuries,
nor the low and quiet villages clustering around, each like a family
of bushy-headed children surrounding their venerable mother.</p>
<p>In addition to these considerations, there was another that moved
me to this walk.&nbsp; Although I had been up and down the country as
often and as extensively as any American, perhaps, and admired its general
scenery, I had never looked at it with an agricultural eye or interest.&nbsp;
But, having dabbled a little in farming in the interval between my last
two visits to England, and being touched with some of the enthusiasm
that modern novices carry into the occupation, I was determined to look
at the agriculture of Great Britain more leisurely and attentively,
and from a better stand-point than I had ever done before.&nbsp; The
thought had also occurred to me, that a walk through the best agricultural
counties of England and Scotland would afford opportunity for observation
which might be made of some interest to my friends and neighbor farmers
in America as well as to myself.&nbsp; Therefore I beg the English reader
to remember that I am addressing to them the notes that I may make by
the way, hoping that its incidents and the thoughts it suggests will
not be devoid of interest because they are principally intended for
the American ear.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p><i>FIRST DAY&rsquo;S OBSERVATIONS AND ENJOYMENT&mdash;RURAL FOOT-PATHS;
VISIT TO TIPTREE FARM&mdash;ALDERMAN MECHI&rsquo;S OPERATIONS&mdash;IMPROVEMENTS
INTRODUCED, DECRIED, AND ADOPTED&mdash;STEAM POWER, UNDER-DRAINING,
DEEP TILLAGE, IRRIGATION&mdash;PRACTICAL RESULTS.</i></p>
<p>On Wednesday, July 15th, 1863, I left London with the hope that I
might be able to accomplish the northern half of my proposed &ldquo;Walk
from Land&rsquo;s End to John O&rsquo;Groat&rsquo;s.&rdquo;&nbsp; I
had been practically prostrated by a serious indisposition for nearly
two months, and was just able to walk one or two miles at a time about
the city.&nbsp; Believing that country air and exercise would soon enable
me to be longer on my feet, I concluded to set out as I was, without
waiting for additional strength, so slow and difficult to attain in
the smoky atmosphere and hot streets of London.</p>
<p>Few reading farmers in America there are who are not familiar with
the name and fame of Alderman Mechi, as an agriculturist of that new
and scientific school that is making such a revolution in the great
primeval industry of mankind.&nbsp; His experiments on his Tiptree Farm
have attained a world-wide publicity, and have given that homestead
an interest that, perhaps, never attached to the same number of acres
in any country or age.&nbsp; Thinking that this famous establishment
would be a good starting point for my pedestrian tour, I concluded to
proceed thither first by railway, and thence to walk northward, by easy
stages, through the fertile and rural county of Essex.&nbsp; Taking
an afternoon train, I reached Kelvedon about 5 p.m.,&mdash;the station
for Tiptree, and a good specimen of an English village, at two hours&rsquo;
ride from London.&nbsp; Calling at the residence of a Friend, or Quaker,
to inquire the way to the Alderman&rsquo;s farm, he invited me to take
tea with him, and be his guest for the night,&mdash;a hospitality which
I very gladly accepted, as it was a longer walk than I had anticipated.&nbsp;
After tea, my host, who was a farmer as well as miller, took me over
his fields, and showed me his live stock, his crops of wheat, barley,
oats, beans, and roots, which were all large and luxuriant, and looked
a <i>tableau vivant</i> of plenty within the green hedges that enclosed
and adorned them.</p>
<p>The next morning, after breakfast, my kind host set me on the way
to Tiptree by a footpath through alternating fields of wheat, barley,
oats, beans, and turnips, into which an English farm is generally divided.&nbsp;
These footpaths are among the vested interests of the walking public
throughout the United Kingdom.&nbsp; Most of them are centuries old.&nbsp;
The footsteps of a dozen generations have given them the force and sanctity
of a popular right.&nbsp; A farmer might as well undertake to barricade
the turnpike road as to close one of these old paths across his best
fields.&nbsp; So far from obstructing them, he finds it good policy
to straighten and round them up, and supply them with convenient gates
or stiles, so that no one shall have an excuse for trampling on his
crops, or for diverging into the open field for a shorter cut to the
main road.&nbsp; Blessings on the man who invented them!&nbsp; It was
done when land was cheap, and public roads were few; before four wheels
were first geared together for business or pleasure.&nbsp; They were
the doing of another age; this would not have produced them.&nbsp; They
run through all the prose, poetry, and romance of the rural life of
England, permeating the history of green hedges, thatched cottages,
morning songs of the lark, moonlight walks, meetings at the stile, harvest
homes of long ago, and many a romantic narrative of human experience
widely read in both hemispheres.&nbsp; They will run on for ever, carrying
with them the same associations.&nbsp; They are the inheritance of landless
millions, who have trodden them in ages past at dawn, noon, and night,
to and from their labor; and in ages to come the mowers and reapers
shall tread them to the morning music of the lark, and through Spring,
Summer, Autumn, and Winter, they shall show the fresh checker-work of
the ploughman&rsquo;s hob-nailed shoe.&nbsp; The surreptitious innovations
of utilitarian science shall not poach upon these sacred preserves of
the people, whatever revolutions they may produce in the machinery and
speed of turnpike locomotion.&nbsp; These pleasant and peaceful paths
through park, and pasture, meandering through the beautiful and sweet-breathing
artistry of English agriculture, are guaranteed to future generations
by an authority which no legislation can annul.</p>
<p>A walk of a few miles brought me in sight of Tiptree Hall; and its
first aspect relieved my mind of an impression which, in common with
thousands better informed, I had entertained in reference to the establishment.&nbsp;
An idea has generally prevailed among English farmers, and agriculturists
of other countries who have heard of Alderman Mechi&rsquo;s experiments,
that they were impracticable and almost valueless, because they would
not <i>pay</i>; that the balance-sheet of his operations did and must
ever show such ruinous discrepancy between income and expenditure as
must deter any man, of less capital and reckless enthusiasm, from following
his lead into such unconsidered ventures.&nbsp; In short, he has been
widely regarded at home and abroad as a bold and dashing novice in agricultural
experience, ready to lavish upon his own hasty inventions a fortune
acquired in his London warehouse; and all this to make himself famous
as a great light in the agricultural world, which light, after all,
was a mere will-o&rsquo;-the-wisp sort of affair, leading its dupes
into the veriest bog of bankruptcy.&nbsp; In common with all those bold,
self-reliant spirits that have ventured to break away from the antecedents
of public opinion and custom, he has been the subject of many ungenerous
innuendoes and criticisms.&nbsp; All kinds of ambitions and motives
have been ascribed to him.&nbsp; Many a burly, red-faced farmer, who
boasts of an unbroken agricultural lineage reaching back into the reign
of Good Queen Bess, will tell you over his beer that the Alderman&rsquo;s
doings are all <i>gammon</i>; that they are all to advertise his cutlery
business in Leadenhall Street, Barnum fashion; to inveigle down to Tiptree
Hall noblemen, foreign ambassadors, and great people of different countries,
and bribe &ldquo;an honourable mention&rdquo; out of them with champagne
treats and oyster suppers.&nbsp; Indeed, my Quaker host largely participated
in this opinion, and took no pains to conceal it when speaking of his
enterprising neighbor.</p>
<p>From what I had read and heard of the Tiptree Hall estate, I expected
to see a grand, old, baronial mansion, surrounded with elegant and costly
buildings for housing horses, cattle, sheep, and other live stock, all
erected on a scale which no <i>bona fide</i> farmer could adopt or approximately
imitate.&nbsp; In a word, I fancied his barns and stables would even
surpass in this respect the establishments of some of those most wealthy
New York or Boston merchants, who think they are stimulating country
farmers to healthy emulation by lavishing from thirty to forty thousand
dollars on a barn and its appurtenant out-houses.&nbsp; With these preconceived
ideas, it was an unexpected satisfaction to see quite a simple-looking,
unassuming establishment, which any well-to-do farmer might make and
own.&nbsp; The house is rather a large and solid-looking building, erected
by Mr. Mechi himself, but not at all ostentatious of wealth or architectural
taste.&nbsp; The barns and &ldquo;steddings,&rdquo; or what we call
cowhouses in America, are of a very ordinary cast, or such as any country-bred
farmer would call economical and simple.&nbsp; The homestead occupies
no picturesque site, and commands no interesting scenery.&nbsp; The
farm consists of about 170 acres, which, in England, is regarded as
a rather small holding.&nbsp; The land is naturally sterile and hard
of cultivation, most of it apparently being heavily mixed with ferruginous
matter.&nbsp; When ploughed deeply, the clods turned up look frequently
like compact masses of iron ore.&nbsp; Every experienced farmer knows
the natural poverty of such a soil, and the hard labor to man and beast
it costs to till it.</p>
<p>To my great regret, Mr. Mechi was not at home, though he passes most
of his time in Summer at Tiptree.&nbsp; But his foreman, who enters
into all the experiments and operations which have made the establishment
so famous, with almost equal interest and enthusiasm, took me through
the farm buildings, and all the fields, and showed me the whole process
and machinery employed.&nbsp; Any English or American agriculturist
who has read of Alderman Mechi&rsquo;s operations, would be inclined
to ask, on looking, for the first time, at his buildings and the fields
surrounding them, what is the great distinguishing speciality of his
enterprise.&nbsp; His land is poor; his housings are simple; there is
no outside show of uncommon taste or genius.&nbsp; Every acre is tile-drained,
to be sure.&nbsp; But that is nothing new nor uncommon.&nbsp; Drainage
is the order of the day.&nbsp; Any tenant farmer in England can have
his land drained by the Government by paying six per cent. annually
on the cost of the job.&nbsp; His expenditure for artificial manure
does not exceed that of hundreds of good farmers.&nbsp; He carries out
the deep tillage system most liberally.&nbsp; So do other scientific
agriculturalists in Europe and America.&nbsp; Of course, a few hours&rsquo;
observation would not suffice for a full and correct conclusion on this
point, but it gave me the impression that the great operation which
has won for the Tiptree Farm its special distinction is its irrigation
with liquid manure.&nbsp; In this respect it stands unrivalled, and,
perhaps, unimitated.&nbsp; And this, probably, is the head and front
of his offending to those who criticise his economy and decry his experiments.</p>
<p>This irrigation is performed through the medium of a small steam
engine and sixteen hydrants, so posted and supplied with hose as to
reach every square foot of the 170 acres.&nbsp; The water used for this
purpose is mostly, if not entirely, supplied from the draining pipes,
even in the dryest season.&nbsp; The manure thus liquified is made by
a comparatively small number of animals.&nbsp; Calves to the value of
&pound;50 are bought, and fat stock to that of &pound;500 are sold annually.&nbsp;
They are all stabled throughout the year, except in harvest time, when
they are turned out for a few weeks to rowen feed.&nbsp; The calves
are housed until a year old in a large stedding by themselves.&nbsp;
They are then transferred to another building, and put upon &ldquo;the
boards;&rdquo; that is in a long stable or cowhouse, with a flooring
of slats, through which the manure drops into a cellar below, made water-tight.&nbsp;
Here the busiest little engine in the world is brought to bear upon
it, with all its faculties of suction and propulsion.&nbsp; Through
one pipe it forces fresh water in upon this mass of manure, which, when
liquified, runs down into a subterranean cistern or reservoir capable
of holding over 100,000 gallons.&nbsp; From this it is propelled into
any field to be irrigated.&nbsp; To prevent any sediment in the great
reservoir, or to make an even mixture of the liquified manure, a hose
is attached to the engine, and the other end dropped into the mass.&nbsp;
Through this a constant volume of air is propelled with such force as
to set the whole boiling and foaming like a little cataract.&nbsp; One
man at the engine and two at the hose in the distant field perform the
whole operation.&nbsp; The chapped and &ldquo;baky&rdquo; surface of
the farm is thus softened and enriched at will, and rendered productive.</p>
<p>Now, this operation seems to constitute the present distinctive speciality
of Alderman Mechi&rsquo;s Tiptree Farm.&nbsp; Will it pay? ask a thousand
voices.&nbsp; In how many years will he get his money back?&nbsp; Give
us the balance sheet of the experiment.&nbsp; A New Englander, favorably
impressed with the process, would be likely to answer these questions
by another, and ask, will <i>drainage</i> pay?&nbsp; Not in one year,
assuredly, nor in five; not in ten, perhaps.&nbsp; The British Government
assumes that all the expenditure upon under-drainage will be paid back
in fifteen or twenty years at the farthest.&nbsp; It lends money to
the land-owner on this basis; and the land-owner stipulates with his
tenant that he shall reimburse him by annual instalments of six or seven
per cent. until the whole cost of the operation is liquidated.&nbsp;
Thus the tenant-farmer is willing to pay six, sometimes seven per cent.
annually, for twenty years, for the increased capacity of production
which drainage gives to the farm he cultivates.&nbsp; At the end of
that period the Government is paid by the landlord, and the landlord
by the tenant, and the tenant by his augmented crops for the whole original
outlay upon the land.&nbsp; For aught either of the three parties to
the operation knows to the contrary, it must all be done over again
at the end of twenty years.&nbsp; The system is too young yet, even
in England, for any one to say how long a course of tubing will last,
or how often it must be relaid.</p>
<p>One point, therefore, has been gained.&nbsp; No intelligent English
farmer, who has tried the system, now asks if under-drainage will pay;
nor does he expect that it will pay back the whole expenditure in less
than twelve or fifteen years.&nbsp; Here is a generous faith in the
operation on the side of all the parties concerned.&nbsp; Then why should
not Alderman Mechi&rsquo;s irrigation system be put on the same footing,
in the matter of public confidence?&nbsp; It is nothing very uncommon
even for a two-hundred-acre farmer in England to have a small stationary
or locomotive steam-engine, and to find plenty of work for it, too,
in threshing his grain, grinding his fodder, pulping his roots, cutting
his hay and straw, and for other purposes.&nbsp; Mr. Mechi would doubtless
have one for these objects alone.&nbsp; So its cost must not be charged
to the account of irrigation.&nbsp; A single course of iron tubing,
a third of a mile long, reaching to the centre of his farthest field,
cannot cost more, with all the hose employed, than the drainage of that
field, while it would be fair to assume that the iron pipes will last
twice as long as those of burnt clay.&nbsp; They might fairly be expected
to hold good for forty years.&nbsp; If, then, for this period, or less,
the process yields ten per cent. of increased production annually, over
and above the effect of all other means employed, it is quite evident
that it will pay as well as drainage.</p>
<p>But does it augment the yearly production of the farm by this amount?&nbsp;
To say that it is the only process by which the baky and chappy soil
of Tiptree can be thoroughly fertilised, would not suffice to prove
its necessity or value to other soils of different composition.&nbsp;
One fact, however, may be sufficient to determine its virtue.&nbsp;
The fields of clover, and Italian rye-grass, etc., are mown three and
even four times in one season, and afterwards fed with sheep.&nbsp;
Certainly, no other system could produce all this cropping.&nbsp; The
distinctive difference it makes in other crops cannot, perhaps, be made
so palpable.&nbsp; The wheat looked strong and heavy, with a fair promise
of forty-five bushels to an acre.&nbsp; The oats, beans, and roots showed
equally well.</p>
<p>The irrigation and deep tillage systems were going on simultaneously
in the same field, affording me a good opportunity of seeing the operation
of both.&nbsp; Two men were plying the hose upon a portion of the field
which had already been mowed three times.&nbsp; Two teams were at work
turning up the other, which had already been cropped once or twice.&nbsp;
One of two horses went first, and, with a common English plough, turned
an ordinary furrow.&nbsp; Then the other followed, of twice the force
of the first, in the same furrow, with a subsoil plough held to the
work beam-deep.&nbsp; The iron-stones and ferruginous clods turned up
by this &ldquo;deep tillage&rdquo; would make a prairie farmer of Illinois
wonder, if not shudder, at the plucky and ingenious industry which competes
with his easy toil and cheap land in providing bread for the landless
millions of Great Britain.</p>
<p>The only exceptional feature or arrangement, besides the irrigating
machinery and process, that I noticed, was an iron hurdling for folding
sheep.&nbsp; This, at first sight, might look to a practical farmer
a little extravagant, indicating a city origin, or the notion of an
amateur agriculturist, more ambitious of the new than of the necessary.&nbsp;
Each length of this iron fencing is apparently about a rod, and cost
&pound;1, or nearly five dollars.&nbsp; It is fitted to low wheels,
or rollers, on an axle two or three feet in length, so that it can be
moved easily and quickly in any direction.&nbsp; It would cost over
fifty pounds, or two hundred and fifty dollars, to enclose an acre entirely
with this kind of hurdling.&nbsp; Still, Mr. Mechi would doubtless be
able to show that this large expenditure is a good investment, and pays
well in the long run.&nbsp; The folding of sheep for twenty-four or
forty-eight hours on small patches of clover, trefoil, or turnips, is
a very important department of English farming, both for fattening them
for the market and for putting the land in better heart than any other
fertilising process could effect.&nbsp; Now, a man with this iron fencing
on wheels must be able to make in two hours an enclosure that would
cost him a day or more of busy labor with the old wooden hurdles.</p>
<p>On the whole, a practical farmer, who has no other source of income
than the single occupation of agriculture, would be likely to ask, what
is the realised value of Alderman Mechi&rsquo;s operations to the common
grain and stock-growers of the world?&nbsp; They have excited more attention
or curiosity than any other experiments of the present day; but what
is the real <i>resume</i> of their results?&nbsp; What new principles
has he laid down; what new economy has he reduced to a science that
may be profitably utilised by the million who get their living by farming?&nbsp;
What has he actually done that anybody else has adopted or imitated
to any tangible advantage?&nbsp; These are important questions; and
this is the way he undertakes to answer them, beginning with the last.</p>
<p>About twenty years ago, he inaugurated the system of under-draining
the heavy tile-clay lands in Essex.&nbsp; Up to his experiment, the
process was deemed impracticable and worthless by the most intelligent
farmers of the county.&nbsp; It was more confidently decried than his
present irrigation system.&nbsp; The water would never find its way
down into the drain-pipes through such clay.&nbsp; It stood to reason
that it would do no such thing.&nbsp; Did not the water stand in the
track of the horse&rsquo;s hoof in such rich clay until evaporated by
the sun?&nbsp; It might as well leak through an earthenware basin.&nbsp;
It was all nonsense to bury a man&rsquo;s money in that style.&nbsp;
He never would see a shilling of it back again.&nbsp; In the face of
these opinions, Mr. Mechi went on, training his pipes through field
after field, deep below the surface.&nbsp; And the water percolated
through the clay into them, until all these long veins formed a continuous
and rushing stream into the main artery that now furnishes an ample
supply for his stabled cattle, for his steam engine, and for all the
barn-yard wants.&nbsp; His tile-draining of clay-lands was a capital
success; and those who derided and opposed it have now adopted it to
their great advantage, and to the vast augmentation of the value and
production of the county.&nbsp; Here, then, is one thing in which he
has led, and others have followed to a great practical result.</p>
<p>His next leading was in the way of agricultural machinery.&nbsp;
He first introduced a steam engine for farming purposes in a district
containing a million of acres.&nbsp; That, too, at the outset, was a
fantastic vagary in the opinion of thousands of solid and respectable
farmers.&nbsp; They insisted the Iron Horse would be as dangerous in
the barn-yard or rick-yard as the very dragon in Scripture; that he
would set everything on fire; kill the men who had care of him; burst
and blow up himself and all the buildings into the air; that all the
horses, cows, and sheep would be frightened to death at the very sight
of the monster, and never could be brought to lie down in peace and
safety by his side, even when his blood was cold, and when he was fast
asleep.&nbsp; To think of it! to have a tall chimney towering up over
a barn-gable or barn-yard, and puffing out black coal smoke, cotton-factory-wise!&nbsp;
Pretty talk! pretty terms to train an honest and virtuous farmer to
mouth!&nbsp; Wouldn&rsquo;t it be edifying to hear him string the yarn
of these new words! to hear him tell of his <i>engineer</i> and ploughman;
of his <i>pokers</i> and pitchforks; of <i>six-horse power, valves,
revolutions, stopcocks, twenty pounds of steam</i>, etc.; mixing up
all this ridiculous stuff with yearling-calves, turnips, horse-carts,
oil-cake, wool, bullocks, beans, and sheep, and other vital things and
interests, which forty centuries have looked upon with reverence!&nbsp;
To plough, thresh, cut turnips, grind corn, and pump water for cattle
by steam!&nbsp; What next?</p>
<p>Why, next, the farmers of the region round about</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;First pitied, then embraced&rdquo;</p>
<p>this new and powerful auxiliary to agricultural industry, after having
watched its working and its worth.&nbsp; And now, thanks to such bold
and spirited novices as Mr. Mechi&mdash;men who had the pluck to work
steadily on under the pattering rain of derisive epithets&mdash;there
are already nearly as many steam engines working at farm labor between
Land&rsquo;s End and John O&rsquo;Groat&rsquo;s as there are employed
in the manufacture of cotton in Great Britain.</p>
<p>His irrigation system will doubtless be followed in the same order
and interval by those who have pooh-poohed it with the same derision
and incredulity as the other innovations they have already adopted.&nbsp;
The utilising of the sewage of large towns, especially of London, has
now become a prominent idea and movement.&nbsp; Mr. Mechi&rsquo;s machinery
and process are admirably adapted to the work of distributing a river
of this fertilising material over any farm to which it may be conducted.&nbsp;
Thus, there is good reason to believe that the very process he originated
for softening and enriching the hard and sterile acres of his small
farm in Essex will be adopted for saturating millions of acres in Great
Britain with the millions of tons of manurial matter that have hitherto
blackened and poisoned the rivers of the country on their wasteful way
to the sea.&nbsp; This will be only an additional work for the farm
engines now in operation, accomplished with but little increased expense.&nbsp;
A single fact may illustrate the irrigating capacity of Mr. Mechi&rsquo;s
machinery.&nbsp; It throws upon a field a quantity of the fertilising
fluid equal to one inch of rainfall at a time, or 100 tons per imperial
acre.&nbsp; And, as a proof of how deep it penetrates, the drains run
freely with it, thus showing conclusively that the subsoil has been
well saturated, a point of vital importance to the crop.</p>
<p>Deep tillage is another speciality that distinguished the Tiptree
Farm <i>regime</i> at the beginning, in which Mr. Mechi led, and in
which he has been followed by the farmers of the country, although few
have come up abreast of him as yet in the system.</p>
<p>Here, then, are four specific departments of improvement in agricultural
industry which the Alderman has introduced.&nbsp; Every one of them
has been ridiculed as an impracticable and useless innovation in its
turn.&nbsp; Three of them have already been adopted, and virtually incorporated
with agricultural science and economy; and the fourth, or irrigation
by steam power, bids fair to find as much favor, and as many adherents
in the end as the others have done.</p>
<p>He has not only originated these improvements, or been the first
to give them practical experiment, but he has laid down certain principles
which will doubtless exercise much influence in shaping the industrial
economy of agriculture hereafter in different countries.&nbsp; One of
the best of these principles he puts in the form of a mathematical proposition.&nbsp;
Thus:&mdash;As the meat is to the manure, so is the crop to the land.&nbsp;
Tell me, he says, how much meat you make, and I will tell you how much
corn you make, to the acre.&nbsp; Meat, then, is the starting point
with him; the basis of his annual production, to which he looks for
a satisfactory decision of his balance-sheet.&nbsp; To show the value
he attaches to this element, the fact will suffice that he usually keeps
65 bullocks, cows, and calves, 100 sheep, and a number of pigs, besides
his horses, making one head to every acre of his farm.&nbsp; With this
amount of live stock he makes from &pound;4 to &pound;5 worth of meat
per acre annually.&nbsp; Perhaps it would be safe to say that no other
170 acres of land in the world make more meat, manure, and grain in
the year than the Tiptree Farm.&nbsp; In these results Mr. Mechi thinks
his experiments and improvements have proved</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Quod es demonstrandum</i>.</p>
<p>Having gone over the farm pretty thoroughly, and noticed all the
leading features of the establishment, I was requested by the foreman
to enter my name in the visitor&rsquo;s book kept in his neat cottage
parlor.&nbsp; It is a large volume, with the ruling running across both
the wide pages; the left apportioned to name, town, country, and profession;
the right to remarks of the visitor.&nbsp; It is truly a remarkable
book of interesting autographs and observations, which the philologist
as well as agriculturist might pore over with lively satisfaction.&nbsp;
It not only contains the names and comments of many of the most distinguished
personages in Great Britain, but those of all other countries of Europe,
even of Asia and Africa, as well as America.&nbsp; Foreign ambassadors,
Continental savans, men of fame in the literary, scientific, and political
world have here recorded their names and impressions in the most unique
succession and blending.&nbsp; Here, under one date, is a party of Italian
gentlemen, leaving their autographs and their observations in the softest
syllables of their language.&nbsp; Then several German connoisseurs
follow in their peculiar script, with comments worded heavily with hard-mouthed
consonants.&nbsp; Then comes, perhaps, a single Russian nobleman, who
expresses his profound satisfaction in the politest French.&nbsp; Next
succeed three or four Spanish <i>Dons</i>, with a long fence of names
attached to each, who give their views of the establishment in the grave,
sonorous words of their language.&nbsp; Here, now, an American puts
in his autograph, with his sharp, curt notion of the matter, as &ldquo;first-rate.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Very likely a turbaned Mufti or Singh of the Oriental world follows
the New England farmer.&nbsp; Danish and Swedish knights prolong the
procession, mingling with Australian wool-growers, Members of the French
Royal Academy, Canadian timber-merchants, Dutch Mynheers, Brazilian
coffee-planters, Belgian lace-makers, and the representatives of all
other countries and professions in Christendom.&nbsp; An autograph-monger,
with the mania strong upon him, of unscrupulous curiosity, armed furtively
with a keen pair of scissors would be a dangerous person to admit to
the presence of that big book without a policeman at his elbow.</p>
<p>Tiptree Hall has its own literature also, in two or three volumes,
written by Mr. Mechi himself, and describing fully his agricultural
experience and experiments, and giving facts and arguments which every
English and American farmer might study with profit.</p>

ne&rsquo;er think who made them, and who taught<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The

<p>Having spent a couple of hours very pleasantly at Tiptree Hall, I
turned my face in a northerly direction for a walk through the best
agricultural section of Essex.&nbsp; While passing through a grass field
recently mown, a lark flew up from almost under my feet.&nbsp; And there,
partially overarched by a tuft of clover, was her little all of earth&mdash;a
snug, warm nest with two small eggs in it, about the size and color
of those of the ground-chirping-bird of New England, which is nearer
the English lark than any other American bird.&nbsp; I bent down to
look at them with an interest an American could only feel.&nbsp; To
him the lark is to the bird-world&rsquo;s companionship and music what
the angels are to the spirit land.&nbsp; He has read and dreamed of
both from his childhood up.&nbsp; He has believed in both poetically
and pleasantly, sometimes almost positively, as real and beautiful individualities.&nbsp;
He almost credits the poet of his own country, who speaks of hearing
&ldquo;the downward beat of angel wings.&rdquo;&nbsp; In his facile
faith in the substance of picturesque and happy shadows, he sometimes
tries to believe that the <i>ph&oelig;nix</i> may have been, in some
age and country, a real, living bird, of flesh and blood and genuine
feathers, with long, strong wings, capable of performing the strange
psychological feats ascribed to it in that most edifying picture emblazoned
on the arms of Banking Companies, Insurance Offices, and Quack Doctors.&nbsp;
He is not sure that dying swans have not sung a mournful hymn over their
last moments, under an affecting and human sense of their mortality.&nbsp;
He has believed in the English lark to the same point of pleasing credulity.&nbsp;
Why should he not give its existence the same faith?&nbsp; The history
of its life is as old as the English alphabet, and older still.&nbsp;
It sang over the dark and hideous lairs of the bloody Druids centuries
before Julius C&aelig;sar was born, and they doubtless had a pleasant
name for it, unless true music was hateful to their ears.&nbsp; It sang,
without loss or change of a single note of this morning&rsquo;s song,
to the Roman legions as they marched, or made roads in Britain.&nbsp;
It rang the same voluntaries to the Saxons, Danes, and Normans, through
the long ages, and, perhaps, tended to soften their antagonisms, and
hasten their blending into one great and mighty people.&nbsp; How the
name and song of this happiest of earthly birds run through all the
rhyme and romance of English poetry, of English rural life, ever since
there was an England!&nbsp; Take away its history and its song from
her daisy-eyed meadows, and shaded lanes, and hedges breathing and blooming
with sweetbrier leaves and hawthorn flowers&mdash;from her thatched
cottages, veiled with ivy&mdash;from the morning tread of the reapers,
and the mower&rsquo;s lunch of bread and cheese under the meadow elm,
and you take away a living and beautiful spirit more charming than music.&nbsp;
You take away from English poetry one of its pleiades, and bereave it
of a companionship more intimate than that of the nearest neighborhood
of the stars above.&nbsp; How the lark&rsquo;s life and song blend,
in the rhyme of the poet, with &ldquo;the sheen of silver fountains
leaping to the sea,&rdquo; with morning sunbeams and noontide thoughts,
with the sweetest breathing flowers, and softest breezes, and busiest
bees, and greenest leaves, and happiest human industries, loves, hopes,
and aspirations!</p>
<p>The American has read and heard of all this from his youth up to
the day of setting his foot, for the first time, on English ground.&nbsp;
He has tried to believe it, as in things seen, temporal and tangible.&nbsp;
But in doing this he has to contend with a sense or suspicion of unreality&mdash;a
feeling that there has been great poetical exaggeration in the matter.&nbsp;
A patent fact lies at the bottom of this incredulity.&nbsp; The forefathers
of New England carried no wild bird with them to sing about their cabin
homes in the New World.&nbsp; But they found beautiful and happy birds
on that wild continent, as well-dressed, as graceful in form and motion,
and of as fine taste for music and other accomplishments, as if they
and their ancestors had sung before the courts of Europe for twenty
generations.&nbsp; These sang their sweet songs of welcome to the Pilgrims
as they landed from the &ldquo;Mayflower.&rdquo;&nbsp; These sang to
them cheerily, through the first years and the later years of their
stern trials and tribulations.&nbsp; These built their nests where the
blue eyes of the first white children born in the land could peer in
upon the speckled eggs with wonder and delight.&nbsp; What wonder that
those strong-hearted puritan fathers and mothers, who</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Made the aisles of the dim wood
ring<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the anthems of the
free,&rdquo;</p>
<p>should love the fellowship of these native singers of the field and
forest, and give them names their hearts loved in the old home land
beyond the sea!&nbsp; They did not consult Linn&aelig;us, nor any musty
Latin genealogy of Old World birds, at the christening of these songsters.&nbsp;
There was a good family resemblance in many cases.&nbsp; The blustering
partridge, brooding over her young in the thicket, was very nearly like
the same bird in England.&nbsp; For the mellow-throated thrush of the
old land they found a mate in the new, of the same size, color, and
general habits, though less musical.&nbsp; The blackbird was nearly
the same in many respects, though the smaller American wore a pair of
red epaulettes.&nbsp; The swallows had their coat tails cut after the
same old English pattern, and built their nests after the same model,
and twittered under the eaves with the same ecstacy, and played the
same antics in the air.&nbsp; But the two dearest home-birds of the
fatherland had no family relations nor counterparts in America; and
the pilgrim fathers and their children could not make their humble homes
happy without the lark and the robin, at least in name and association;
so they looked about them for substitutes.&nbsp; There was a plump,
full-chested bird, in a chocolate-colored vest, with a bluish dress
coat, that would mount the highest tree-top in early spring, and play
his flute by the hour for very joy to see the snow melt and the buds
swell again.&nbsp; There was such a rollicking happiness in his loud,
clear notes, and he apparently sang them in such sympathy with human
fellowships, and hopes, and homes, and he was such a cheery and confiding
denizen of the orchard and garden withal, that he became at once the
pet bird of old and young, and was called the <i>robin</i>; and well
would it be if its English namesake possessed its sterling virtues;
for, with all its pleasant traits and world-wide reputation, the English
robin is a pretentious, arrogant busybody, characteristically pugilistic
and troublesome in the winged society of England.&nbsp; In form, dress,
deportment, disposition, and in voice and taste for vocal music, the
American robin surpasses the English most decidedly.&nbsp; In this our
grave forefathers did more than justice to the home-bird they missed
on Plymouth Rock.&nbsp; In this generous treatment of their affection
for it, they perhaps condoned for mating the English lark so incongruously;
but it was true their choice was very limited.&nbsp; To match the <i>prima
donna carissima</i> of English field and sky, it was necessary to select
a meadow bird, with some other features of resemblance.&nbsp; It would
never do to give the cherished name and association to one that lived
in the forest, or built its nest in the tree-tops or house-tops, or
to one that was black, yellow, or red.&nbsp; Having to conciliate all
these conditions, and do the best with the material at hand, they pitched
upon a rather large, brownish bird, in a drab waistcoat, slightly mottled,
and with a loud, cracked voice, which nobody ever liked.&nbsp; So it
never became a favorite, even to those who first gave it the name of
lark.&nbsp; It was not its only defect that it lacked an ear and voice
for music.&nbsp; There is always a scolding accent that marks its conversation
with other birds in the brightest mornings of June.&nbsp; He is very
noisy, but never merry nor musical.&nbsp; Indeed, compared with the
notes of the English lark, his are like the vehement ejaculations of
a maternal duck in distress.</p>
<p>Take it in all, no bird in either hemisphere equals the English lark
in heart or voice, for both unite to make it the sweetest, happiest,
the welcomest singer that was ever winged, like the high angels of God&rsquo;s
love.&nbsp; It is the living ecstacy of joy when it mounts up into its
&ldquo;glorious privacy of light.&rdquo;&nbsp; On the earth it is timid,
silent, and bashful, as if not at home, and not sure of its right to
be there at all.&nbsp; It is rather homely withal, having nothing in
feather, feature, or form, to attract notice.&nbsp; It is seemingly
made to be heard, not seen, reversing the old axiom addressed to children
when getting voicy.&nbsp; Its mission is music, and it floods a thousand
acres of the blue sky with it several times a day.&nbsp; Out of that
palpitating speck of living joy there wells forth a sea of twittering
ecstacy upon the morning and evening air.&nbsp; It does not ascend by
gyrations, like the eagle or birds of prey.&nbsp; It mounts up like
a human aspiration.&nbsp; It seems to spread out its wings and to be
lifted straight upwards out of sight by the afflatus of its own happy
heart.&nbsp; To pour out this in undulating rivulets of rhapsody is
apparently the only motive of its ascension.&nbsp; This it is that has
made it so loved of all generations.&nbsp; It is the singing angel of
man&rsquo;s nearest heaven, whose vital breath is music.&nbsp; Its sweet
warbling is only the metrical palpitation of its life of joy.&nbsp;
It goes up over the roof-trees of the rural hamlet on the wings of its
song, as if to train the rural soul to trial flights heavenward.&nbsp;
Never did the Creator put a voice of such volume into so small a living
thing.&nbsp; It is a marvel&mdash;almost a miracle.&nbsp; In a still
hour you can hear it at nearly a mile&rsquo;s distance.&nbsp; When its
form is lost in the hazy lace-work of the sun&rsquo;s rays above, it
pours down upon you all the thrilling semitones of its song as distinctly
as if it were warbling to you in your window.</p>
<p>The only American bird that could star it with the English lark,
and win any admiration at a popular concert by its side, is our favourite
comic singer, the <i>Bobolink</i>.&nbsp; I have thought often, when
listening to British birds at their morning rehearsals, what a sensation
would ensue if Master Bob, in his odd-fashioned bib and tucker, should
swagger into their midst, singing one of those Low-Dutch voluntaries
which he loves to pour down into the ears of our mowers in haying time.&nbsp;
Not only would such an apparition and overture throw the best-trained
orchestra of Old World birds into amazement or confusion, but astonish
all the human listeners at an English concert.&nbsp; With what a wonderment
would one of these blooming, country milkmaids look at the droll harlequin,
and listen to those familiar words of his, set to his own music:-</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go to milk! go to milk!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh,
Miss Phillisey,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dear Miss Phillisey,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What
will Willie say<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you don&rsquo;t
go to milk!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No cheese, no cheese,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No
butter nor cheese<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you don&rsquo;t
go to milk.</p>
<p>It is a wonder that in these days of refined civilization, when Jenny
Lind, Grisi, Patti, and other celebrated European singers, some of them
from very warm climates, are transported to America to delight our Upper-Tendom,
that there should be no persistent and successful effort to introduce
the English lark into our out-door orchestra of singing-birds.&nbsp;
No European voice would be more welcome to the American million.&nbsp;
It would be a great gain to the nation, and be helpful to our religious
devotions, as well as to our secular satisfactions.&nbsp; In several
of our Sabbath hymns there is poetical reference to the lark and its
song.&nbsp; For instance, that favorite psalm of gratitude for returning
Spring opens with these lines:&mdash;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;The winter is over and gone,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
thrush whistles sweet on the spray,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
turtle breathes forth her soft moan,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
<i>lark</i> mounts on high and warbles away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, not one American man, woman, or child in a thousand ever heard
or saw an English lark, and how is he, she, or it to sing the last line
of the foregoing verse with the spirit and understanding due to an exercise
of devotion?&nbsp; The American lark never mounts higher than the top
of a meadow elm, on which it see-saws, and screams, or quacks, till
it is tired; then draws a bee-line for another tree, or a fence-post,
never even undulating on the voyage.&nbsp; It may be said, truly enough,
that the hymn was written in England.&nbsp; Still, if sung in America
from generation to generation, we ought to have the English lark with
us, for our children to see and hear, lest they may be tempted to believe
that other and more serious similes in our Sabbath hymns are founded
on fancy instead of fact.</p>
<p>Nor would it be straining the point, nor be dealing in poetical fancies,
if we should predicate upon the introduction of the English lark into
American society a supplementary influence much needed to unify and
nationalise the heterogeneous elements of our population.&nbsp; Men,
women, and children, speaking all the languages and representing all
the countries and races of Europe, are streaming in upon us weekly in
widening currents.&nbsp; The rapidity with which they become assimilated
to the native population is remarkable.&nbsp; But there is one element
from abroad that does not Americanise itself so easily&mdash;and that,
curiously, is one the most American that comes from Europe&mdash;in
other words, the <i>English</i>.&nbsp; They find with us everything
as English as it can possibly be out of England&mdash;their language,
their laws, their literature, their very bibles, psalm-books, psalm-tunes,
the same faith and forms of worship, the same common histories, memories,
affinities, affections, and general structure of social life and public
institutions; yet they are generally the very last to be and feel at
home in America.&nbsp; A Norwegian mountaineer, in his deerskin doublet,
and with a dozen English words picked up on the voyage, will <i>Americanise</i>
himself more in one year on an Illinois prairie than an intelligent,
middle-class Englishman will do in ten, in the best society of Massachusetts.&nbsp;
Now, I am not dallying with a facetious fantasy when I express the opinion,
that the life and song of the English lark in America, superadded to
the other institutions and influences indicated, would go a great way
in fusing this hitherto insoluble element, and blending it harmoniously
with the best vitalities of the nation.&nbsp; And this consummation
would well repay a special and extraordinary effect.&nbsp; Perhaps this
expedient would be the most successful of all that remain untried.&nbsp;
A single incident will prove that it is more than a mere theory.&nbsp;
Here it is, in substance:&mdash;</p>
<p>Some years ago, when the Australian gold fever was hot in the veins
of thousands, and fleets of ships were conveying them to that far-off,
uncultivated world, a poor old woman landed with the great multitude
of rough and reckless men, who were fired to almost frenzy by dreams
of ponderous nuggets and golden fortunes.&nbsp; For these they left
behind them all the enjoyments, endearments, all the softening sanctities
and surroundings of home and social life in England.&nbsp; For these
they left mothers, wives, sisters and daughters.&nbsp; There they were,
thinly tented in the rain, and the dew, and the mist, a busy, boisterous,
womanless camp of diggers and grubbers, roughing-and-tumbling it in
the scramble for gold mites, with no quiet Sabbath breaks, nor Sabbath
songs, nor Sabbath bells to measure off and sweeten a season of rest.&nbsp;
Well, the poor widow, who had her cabin within a few miles of &ldquo;the
diggings,&rdquo; brought with her but few comforts from the old homeland&mdash;a
few simple articles of furniture, the bible and psalm-book of her youth,
and an English lark to sing to her solitude the songs that had cheered
her on the other side of the globe.&nbsp; And the little thing did it
with all the fervor of its first notes in the English sky.&nbsp; In
her cottage window it sang to her hour by hour at her labor, with a
voice never heard before on that wild continent.&nbsp; The strange birds
of the land came circling around in their gorgeous plumage to hear it.&nbsp;
Even four-footed animals, of grim countenance, paused to hear it.&nbsp;
Then, one by one, came other listeners.&nbsp; They came reverently,
and their voices softened into silence as they listened.&nbsp; Hard-visaged
men, bare-breasted and unshaven, came and stood gentle as girls; and
tears came out upon many a tanned and sun-blistered cheek as the little
bird warbled forth the silvery treble of its song about the green hedges,
the meadow streams, the cottage homes, and all the sunny memories of
the fatherland.&nbsp; And they came near unto the lone widow with pebbles
of gold in their hard and horny hands, and asked her to sell them the
bird, that it might sing to them while they were bending to the pick
and the spade.&nbsp; She was poor, and the gold was heavy; yet she could
not sell the warbling joy of her life.&nbsp; But she told them that
they might come whenever they would to hear it sing.&nbsp; So, on Sabbath
days, having no other preacher nor teacher, nor sanctuary privilege,
they came down in large companies from their gold-pits, and listened
to the devotional hymns of the lark, and became better and happier men
for its music.</p>
<p>Seriously, it may be urged that the refined tastes, arts, and genius
of the present day do not develop themselves symmetrically or simultaneously
in this matter.&nbsp; Here are connoisseurs and enthusiasts in vegetable
nature hunting up and down all the earth&rsquo;s continents for rare
trees, plants, shrubs, and flowers.&nbsp; They are bringing them to
England and America in shiploads, to such extent and variety, that nearly
all the dead languages and many of the living are ransacked to furnish
names for them.&nbsp; Llamas, dromedaries, Cashmere goats, and other
strange animals, are brought, thousands of miles by sea and land, to
be acclimatised and domesticated to these northern countries.&nbsp;
Artificial lakes are made for the cultivation of fish caught in Antipodean
streams.&nbsp; That is all pleasant and hopeful and proper.&nbsp; The
more of that sort of thing the better.&nbsp; But why not do the other
thing, too?&nbsp; Vattemare made it the mission of his life to induce
people of different countries to exchange books, or unneeded duplicates
of literature.&nbsp; We need an Audubon or Wilson, not to make new collections
of feathered skeletons, and new volumes on ornithology, but to effect
an exchange of living birds between Europe and America; not for caging,
not for Zoological gardens and museums, but for singing their free songs
in our fields and forests.&nbsp; There is no doubt that the English
lark would thrive and sing as well in America as in this country.&nbsp;
And our bobolink would be as easily acclimatised in Europe.&nbsp; Who
could estimate the pleasure which such an exchange in the bird-world
would give to millions on both sides of the Atlantic?</p>
<p>There are some English birds which we could not introduce into the
feathered society of America, any more than we could import a score
of British Dukes and Duchesses, with all their hereditary dignities
and grand surroundings, into the very heart and centre of our democracy.&nbsp;
For instance, the grave and aristocratic rooks, if transported to our
country, would turn up their noses and caw with contempt at our institutions&mdash;even
at our oldest buildings and most solemn and dignified oaks.&nbsp; It
is very doubtful if they would be conciliated into any respect for the
Capitol or The White House at Washington.&nbsp; They have an intuitive
and most discriminating perception of antiquity, and their adhesion
to it is invincible.&nbsp; Whether they came in with the Normans, or
before, history does not say.&nbsp; One thing would seem evident.&nbsp;
They are older than the Order of the Garter, and belonged to feudalism.&nbsp;
They are the living spirits of feudalism, which have survived its human
retainers by several hundred years, and now represent the defunct institution
as pretentiously as in King Stephen&rsquo;s day.&nbsp; They are as fond
of old Norman castles, cathedrals, and churches, as the very ivy itself,
and cling to them with as much pertinacity.&nbsp; For several hundred
generations of bird-life, they and their ancestors have colonised their
sable communities in the baronial park-trees of England, and their descendants
promise to abide for as many generations to come.&nbsp; In size, form,
and color they differ but little from the American crow, but are swifter
on the wing, with greater &ldquo;gift of the gab,&rdquo; and less dignified
in general deportment, though more given to aristocratic airs.&nbsp;
Although they emigrated from France long before &ldquo;<i>La Democratic
Sociale</i>&rdquo; was ever heard of in that country, they may be considered
the founders of the <i>Socialistic</i> theory and practice; and to this
day they live and move in <i>phalansteries</i>, which succeed far better
than those attempted by the American &ldquo;<i>Fourierites</i>&rdquo;
some years ago.&nbsp; As in human communities, the collision of mind
with mind contributes fortuitous scintillations of intelligence to their
general enlightenment; so gregarious animals, birds and bees seem to
acquire especial quick-wittedness from similar intercourse.&nbsp; The
English rook, therefore, is more astute, subtle, and cunning than our
American crow, and some of his feats of legerdemain are quite vulpine.</p>
<p>The jackdaw is to the rook what the Esquimaux is to the Algonquin
Indian; of the same form, color, and general habits, but smaller in
size.&nbsp; They are as fond of ancient abbeys and churches as ever
were the monks of old.&nbsp; Indeed, they have many monkish habits and
predilections, and chatter over their Latin rituals in the storied towers
of old Norman cathedrals, and in the belfries of ivy-webbed churches
in as vivicacious confusion.</p>
<p>There is no country in the world of the same size that has so many
birds in it as England; and there are none so musical and merry.&nbsp;
They all sing here congregationalwise, just as the people do in the
churches and chapels of all religious denominations.&nbsp; As these
buildings were fashioned in early times after the Gothic order of elm
and oak-tree architecture, so the human worshippers therein imitated
the birds, as well as the branches, of those trees, and learned to sing
their Sabbath hymns together, young and old, rich and poor, in the same
general uprising and blending of multitudinous voices.&nbsp; I believe
everything sings that has wings in England.&nbsp; And well it might,
for here it is safe from shot, stones, snares, and other destructives.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Young England&rdquo; is not allowed to sport with firearms, after
the fashion of our American boys.&nbsp; You hear no juvenile popping
at the small birds of the meadow, thicket, or hedge-row, in Spring,
Summer, or Autumn.&nbsp; After travelling and sojourning nearly ten
years in the country, I have never seen a boy throw a stone at a sparrow,
or climb a tree for a bird&rsquo;s-nest.&nbsp; The only birds that are
not expected to die a natural death are the pheasant, partridge, grouse,
and woodcock; and these are to be killed according to the strictest
laws and customs, at a certain season of the year, and then only by
titled or wealthy men who hold their vested interest in the sport among
the most rigid and sacred rights of property.&nbsp; Thus law, custom,
public sentiment, climate, soil, and production, all combine to give
bird-life a development in England that it attains in no other country.&nbsp;
In no other land is it so multitudinous and musical; in none is there
such ample and varied provision for housing and homing it.&nbsp; Every
field is a great bird&rsquo;s-nest.&nbsp; The thick, green hedge that
surrounds it, and the hedge-trees arising at one or two rods&rsquo;
interval, afford nesting and refuge for myriads of these meadow singers.&nbsp;
The groves and thickets are full of them and their music; so full, indeed,
that sometimes every leaf seems to pulsate with a little piping voice
in the general concert.&nbsp; Nor are they confined to the fields, groves,
and hedges of the quiet country.&nbsp; If the census of the sparrows
alone in London could be taken, they would count up to a larger figure
than all the birds of a New England county would reach.&nbsp; Then there
is another interesting feature of this companionship.&nbsp; A great
deal of it lasts through the entire year.&nbsp; There are ten times
as many birds in England as in America in the winter.&nbsp; Here the
fields are green through the coldest months.&nbsp; No deep and drifting
snows cover a frozen earth for ten or twelve weeks, as with us.&nbsp;
There is plenty of shelter and seeds for birds that can stand an occasional
frost or wintry storm, and a great number of them remain the whole year
around the English homesteads.</p>
<p>If such a difference were a full compensation, our North American
birds make up in dress what they fall short of English birds in voice
and musical talent.&nbsp; The robin redbreast and the goldfinch come
out in brighter colors than any other beaux and belles of the season
here; but the latter is only a slender-waisted brunette, and the former
a plump, strutting, little coxcomb, in a mahogany-colored waistcoat.&nbsp;
There is nothing here approaching in vivid colors the New England yellow-bird,
hang-bird, red-bird, indigo-bird, or even the bluebird.&nbsp; In this,
as well as other differences, Nature adjusts the system of compensation
which is designed to equalise the conditions of different countries.</p>

<p><i>TALK WITH AN OLD MAN ON THE WAY&mdash;OLD HOUSES IN ENGLAND&mdash;THEIR
AMERICAN RELATIONSHIPS&mdash;ENGLISH HEDGES AND HEDGE-ROW TREES&mdash;THEIR
PROBABLE FATE&mdash;CHANGE OF RURAL SCENERY WITHOUT THEM.</i></p>
<p>From Tiptree I had a pleasant walk to Coggeshall, a unique and antique
town, marked by the quaint and picturesque architecture of the Elizabethan
<i>regime</i>.&nbsp; On the way I met an old man, eighty-three years
of age, busily at work with his wheel-barrow, shovel, and bush-broom,
gathering up the droppings of manure on the road.&nbsp; I stopped and
had a long talk with him, and learned much of those ingenious and minute
industries by which thousands of poor men house, feed, and clothe themselves
and their families in a country super-abounding with labor.&nbsp; He
had nearly filled his barrow, after trundling it for four miles.&nbsp;
He could sell his little load for 4d. to a neighboring farmer; but he
intended to keep it for a small garden patch allotted to him by his
son, with whom he lived.&nbsp; These few square yards of land constituted
the microscopic point of his attachment to that great globe still holding
in reserve unmeasured territories of productive soil, on which nor plough,
nor spade, nor human foot, nor life has ever left a lasting mark.&nbsp;
These made his little farm, as large to him and to his octogenarian
sinews and ambitions as was the Tiptree Estate to Alderman Mechi.&nbsp;
It filled his mind with as busy occupation and as healthy a stimulus.&nbsp;
That rude barrow, with its clumsy wheel, thinly rimmed with an iron
hoop, was to him what the steam engine, and two miles of iron tubing,
and all its hose-power were to that eminent agriculturist, of whom he
spoke in terms of high esteem as a neighbor, and even as a competitor.&nbsp;
Proportionately they were on the same footing; the one with his 170
square acres, the other with his 170 square feet.&nbsp; It was pleasant
and instructive to hear him speak with such sunny and cheery hope of
his earthly lot and doings.&nbsp; His son was kind and good to him.&nbsp;
He could read, and get many good books.&nbsp; He ate and slept well.&nbsp;
He was poor but comfortable.&nbsp; He went to church on Sunday, and
thought much of heaven on week days.&nbsp; His cabbages were a wonder;
some with heads as large as a half-bushel measure.&nbsp; He did something
very respectable in the potato and turnip line.&nbsp; He had grown beans
and beets which would show well in any market.&nbsp; He always left
a strip or corner for flowers.&nbsp; He loved to grow them; they did
him good, and stirred up young-man feelings in him.&nbsp; He went on
in this way with increased animation, following the lead of a few questions
I put in occasionally to give direction to the narrative of his experience.&nbsp;
How much I wished I could have photographed him as he stood leaning
on his shovel, his wrinkled face and gray, thin hair, moistened with
perspiration, while his coat lay inside out on one of the handles of
his barrow!&nbsp; The July sun, that warmed him at his work, would have
made an interesting picture of him, if some one could have held a camera
to its eye at the moment.&nbsp; I added a few pennies to his stock-in-trade,
and continued my walk, thinking much of that wonderful arrangement of
Providence by which the infinite alternations and gradations of human
life and condition are adjusted; fitting a separate being, experience,
and attachment to every individual heart; training its tendrils to cling
all its life long to one slightly individualised locality, which another
could never call home; giving itself and all its earthly hopes to an
occupation which another would esteem a prison discipline; sucking the
honey of contentment out of a condition which would be wormwood to another
person on the same social level.</p>
<p>On reaching Coggeshall, I became again the guest of a Friend, who
gave me the same old welcome and hospitality which I have so often received
from the members of that society.&nbsp; After tea, he took me about
the town, and showed me those buildings so interesting to an American&mdash;low,
one-story houses, with thatched roofs, clay-colored, wavy walls, rudely-carved
lintels, and iron-sash windows opening outward on hinges like doors,
with squares of glass 3 inches by 4;&mdash;houses which were built before
the keel of the Mayflower was laid, which conveyed the Pilgrims to Plymouth
Rock.&nbsp; Here, now! see that one on the other side of the street,
looking out upon a modern and strange generation through two ivy-browed
eyes just lighted up to visible speculation by a single candle on the
mantel-piece!&nbsp; A very animated and respectable baby was carried
out of that door in its mother&rsquo;s arms, and baptised in the parish
church, before William Shakespeare was weaned.&nbsp; There is a younger
house near by, which was a century old when Washington was born.&nbsp;
These unique, old dwellings of town, village, and hamlet in England,
must ever possess an interest to the American traveller which the grand
and majestic cathedrals, that fill him with so much admiration, cannot
inspire.&nbsp; We link the life of our nation more directly to these
humbler buildings.&nbsp; Our forefathers went out of these houses to
the New World.&nbsp; The log huts they first erected served them and
their families as homes for a few years; then were given to their horses
and cattle for stabling; then were swept away, as too poor for either
man or beast.&nbsp; The second generation of houses made greater pretensions
to comfort, and had their day, then passed away.&nbsp; They were nearly
all one-story, wooden buildings, with a small apartment on each side
of a great chimney, and a little bed-roomage in the garret for children.&nbsp;
Then followed the large, red, New England mansion, broadside to the
road, two stories high in front, with nearly a rood of back roof declining
to within five or six feet of the ground, and covering a great, dark
kitchen, flanked on one side by a bed-room, and on the other by the
buttery.&nbsp; A ponderous chimney arose out of the middle of the building,
giving a fire-place of eight feet back to the kitchen, and one of half
the dimensions to each of the other two large rooms&mdash;the <i>north</i>
and <i>south</i>.&nbsp; For, like the republic they founded, its forefathers
and ours divided their dwellings by a kind of Mason and Dixon&rsquo;s
Line, into two parts, giving them these sectional appellations which
have represented such antagonisms and made us such trouble.&nbsp; Every
one of these old-fashioned houses had its &ldquo;North&rdquo; and &ldquo;South&rdquo;
rooms on the ground-floor, and duplicates, of the same size and name,
above, divided by the massive, hollow tower, called a chimney.&nbsp;
A double front door, with panels, scrolled with rude carving, opened
right and left into the portly building, which, in the <i>tout ensemble</i>,
looked like a New England gentleman of the olden time, in his cocked
hat, and hair done up in a <i>queue</i>.&nbsp; These were the houses
built &ldquo;when George the Third was King.&rdquo;&nbsp; In these were
born the men of the American Revolution.&nbsp; They are the oldest left
in the land; and, like the Revolutionary pensioners, they are fast disappearing.&nbsp;
In a few years, it will be said the last of them has been levelled to
the ground, just as the paragraph will circulate through the newspapers
that the last soldier of the War of Independence is dead.</p>
<p>Thus, the young generation in America, now reciting in our schools
the rudimental facts of the common history of the English-speaking race,
will come to the meridian of manhood at a time when the three first
generations of American houses shall have been swept away.&nbsp; But,
travelling over a space of three centuries&rsquo; breadth, they will
see, in these old English dwellings, where the New World broke off from
the Old&mdash;the houses in which the first settlers of New England
were born; the churches and chapels in which they were baptised, and
the school-houses in which they learned the alphabet of the great language
that is to fill the earth with the speech of man&rsquo;s rights and
God&rsquo;s glory.&nbsp; One hundred millions, speaking the tongue of
Shakespeare and Milton on the American continent, and as many millions
more on continents more recently settled by the same race, across the
ocean, and across century-seas of time, shall moor their memories to
these humble dwellings of England&rsquo;s hamlets, and feel how many
taut and twisted liens attach them to the motherland of mighty nations.</p>
<p>On reckoning up the log of my first day&rsquo;s walk, I found I had
made full twelve miles by road and field; and was more than satisfied
with such a trial of country air and exercise, and with the enjoyment
of its scenery and occupations.&nbsp; The next day I made a longer distance
still, from Coggeshall to Great Bardfield, or about eighteen miles;
and felt at the end that I had established a reasonable claim to convalescence.&nbsp;
The country on the way was marked by the quiet and happy features of
diversified plenty.&nbsp; The green and gold of pastures, meadows, and
wheat-fields; the picturesque interspersion of cottages, gardens, stately
mansions, parks and lawns, all enlivened by a well-proportioned number
of mottled cows feeding or lying along the brook-banks, and sheep grazing
on the uplands,&mdash;all these elements of rural life and scenery were
blended with that fortuitous felicity which makes the charm of Nature&rsquo;s
country pictures.</p>
<p>At Bardfield I was again homed for the night by a Friend; and after
tea made an evening walk with him about the farm of a member of the
same society, living in the outskirts of the town, who cultivates about
400 acres of excellent land, and is considered one of the most practical
and successful agriculturists of Essex.&nbsp; His fields were larger
and fewer than I had noticed on my walk in a farm of equal size.&nbsp;
This feature indicates the modern improvements in English farming more
prominently to the cursory observer than any other that attracts his
eye.&nbsp; It is a rigidly utilitarian innovation on the old system,
that does not at all promise to improve the picturesque aspect of the
country.&nbsp; To &ldquo;reconstruct the map&rdquo; of a county, by
wire-fencing it into squares of 100 acres each, after grubbing up all
the hedges and hedge-trees, would doubtless add seven and a quarter
per cent. to the agricultural production of the shire, and gratify many
a Gradgrind of materialistic economy; but who would know England after
such a transformation?&nbsp; One would be prone to reiterate Patrick&rsquo;s
exclamation of surprise, when he first shouldered a gun and tested the
freedom of the forest in America.&nbsp; Seeing a small bird in the top
of a tree, he pointed the fowling-piece in that direction, turned away
his face, and fired.&nbsp; A tree-toad fell to the ground from an agitated
branch.&nbsp; The exulting Irishman ran and picked it up in triumph,
and held it out at arm&rsquo;s length by one of its hind legs, exclaiming,
&ldquo;And how it alters a bird to shoot its feathers off, to be sure!&rdquo;&nbsp;
It would alter England nearly as much in aspect, if the unsparing despotism
of &pound; s. d. should root out the hedge-row trees, and substitute
invisible lines of wire for the flowering hawthorn as a fencing for
those fields which now look so much like framed portraits of Nature&rsquo;s
best painting.</p>
<p>The tendency of these utilitarian times may well occasion an unpleasant
concern in the lovers of English rural scenery.&nbsp; What changes may
come in the wake of the farmer&rsquo;s steam-engine, steam-plough, or
under the smoke-shadows from his factory-like chimney, these recent
&ldquo;improvements&rdquo; may suggest and induce.&nbsp; One can see
in any direction he may travel these changes going on silently.&nbsp;
Those little, unique fields, defined by lines and shapes unknown to
geometry, are going out of the rural landscape.&nbsp; And when they
are gone, they will be missed more than the amateurs of agricultural
artistry imagine at the present moment.&nbsp; What some one has said
of the peasantry, may be said, with almost equal deprecation, of these
picturesque tit-bits of land, which,&mdash;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Once destroyed, never can be
supplied.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And destroyed they will be, as sure as science.&nbsp; As large farms
are swallowing up the little ones between them, so large fields are
swallowing these interesting patches, the broad-bottomed hedging of
which sometimes measures as many square yards as the space it encloses.</p>
<p>There is much reason to fear that the hedge-trees will, in the end,
meet with a worse fate still.&nbsp; Practical farmers are beginning
to look upon them with an evil eye&mdash;an eye sharp and severe with
pecuniary speculation; that looks at an oak or elm with no artist&rsquo;s
reverence; that darts a hard, dry, timber-estimating glance at the trunk
and branches; that looks at the circumference of its cold shadow on
the earth beneath, not at the grand contour and glorious leafage of
its boughs above.&nbsp; The farmer who was taking us over his large
and highly-cultivated fields, was a man of wide intelligence, of excellent
tastes, and the means wherewithal to give them free scope and play.&nbsp;
His library would have satisfied the ambition of a student of history
or belles-lettres.&nbsp; His gardens, lawn, shrubbery, and flowers would
grace the mansion of an independent gentleman.&nbsp; He had an eye to
the picturesque as well as practical.&nbsp; But I could not but notice,
as significant of the tendency to which I have referred, that, on passing
a large, outbranching oak standing in the boundary of two fields, he
remarked that the detriment of its shadow could not have been less than
ten shillings a year for half a century.&nbsp; As we proceeded from
field to field, he recurred to the same subject by calling our attention
to the circumference of the shadow cast on the best land of the farm
by a thrifty, luxuriant ash, not more than a foot in diameter at the
butt.&nbsp; Up to the broad rim of its shade, the wheat on each side
of the hedge was thick, heavyheaded and tall, but within the cool and
sunless circle the grain and grass were so pale and sickly that the
bare earth would have been relief to a farmer&rsquo;s eye.</p>
<p>The three great, distinctive graces of an English landscape are the
hawthorn hedges, the hedge-row trees, and the everlasting and unapproachable
greenness of the grass-fields they surround and embellish.&nbsp; In
these beautiful features, England surpasses all other countries in the
world.&nbsp; These make the peculiar charm of her rural scenery to a
traveller from abroad.&nbsp; These are the salient lineaments of Motherland&rsquo;s
face which the memories of myriads she has sent to people countries
beyond the sea cling to with such fondness; memories that are transmitted
from generation to generation; which no political revolutions nor severances
affect; which are handed down in the unwritten legends of family life
in the New World, as well as in the warp and woof of American literature
and history.&nbsp; Will the utilitarian and unsparing science of these
latter days, or of the days to come, shear away these beautiful tresses,
and leave the brow and temples of the Old Country they have graced bare
and brown under the bald and burning sun of material economy?&nbsp;
It is not an idle question, nor too early to ask it.&nbsp; It is a question
which will interest more millions of the English race on the American
continent than these home-islands will ever contain.&nbsp; There are
influences at work which tend to this unhappy issue.&nbsp; Some of these
have been already indicated, and others more powerful still may be mentioned.</p>
<p>Agriculture in England has to run the gauntlet of many pressing competitions,
and carry a heavy burden of taxation as it runs.&nbsp; These will be
noticed, hereafter, in their proper connection.&nbsp; Farming, therefore,
is being reduced to a rigid science.&nbsp; Every acre of land must be
put up to its last ounce of production.&nbsp; Every square foot of it
must be utilised to the growth of something for man and beast.&nbsp;
Manures for different soils are tested with as much chemical precision
as ever was quinine for human constitutions.&nbsp; Dynameters are applied
to prove the power of working machinery.&nbsp; Labor is scrutinised
and economised, and measured closely up to the value of a farthing&rsquo;s-worth
of capacity.&nbsp; A shilling&rsquo;s difference per acre in the cost
of ploughing by horse-flesh or steam brings the latter into the field.&nbsp;
The sound of the flail is dying out of the land, and soon will be heard
no more.&nbsp; Even threshing machines worked by horses are being discarded,
as too slow and old-fashioned.&nbsp; Locomotive steam-engines, on broad-rimmed
wheels, may be met on the turnpike road, travelling on their own legs
from farm to farm to thresh out wheat, barley, oats, and beans, for
a few pence per bushel.&nbsp; They make nothing of ascending a hill
without help, or of walking across a ploughed field to a rick-yard.&nbsp;
Iron post and rail fencing, in lengths of twenty feet on wheels, drawn
about by a donkey, bids fair to supersede the old wooden hurdles for
sheep fed on turnips or clover.&nbsp; It is an iron age, and wire fencing
is creeping into use, especially in the most scientifically cultivated
districts of Scotland, where the elements and issues of the farmer&rsquo;s
balance-sheet are looked to with the most eager concern.&nbsp; Iron
wire grows faster than hawthorn or buckthorn.&nbsp; It doubtless costs
less.&nbsp; It needs no yearly trimming, like shrubs with sap and leaves.&nbsp;
It does not occupy a furrow&rsquo;s width as a boundary between two
fields.&nbsp; It may be easily transposed to vary enclosures.&nbsp;
It is not a nesting place for destructive birds or vermin.&nbsp; These
and other arguments, of the same utilitarian genus, are making perceptible
headway.&nbsp; Will they ever carry the day against the green hedges?&nbsp;
I think they would, very soon, if the English farmer owned the land
he cultivates.&nbsp; But such is rarely the case.&nbsp; Still, this
fact may not prevent the final consummation of this policy of material
interest.&nbsp; In a great many instances, the tenant might compromise
with the landlord in such a way as to bring about this &ldquo;modern
improvement.&rdquo;&nbsp; And a comparatively few instances, showing
a certain per centage of increased production per acre to the former,
and a little additional rentage to the latter, would suffice to give
the innovation an impulse that would sweep away half the hedges of the
country, and deface that picture which so many generations have loved
to such enthusiasm of admiration.</p>
<p>Will the trees of the hedge-row be exposed to the same end?&nbsp;
I think they will.&nbsp; Though trees are the most sacred things the
earth begets in England, as has already been said, the farmer here looks
at them with an evil eye, as horse-leeches that bleed to death long
stretches of the land he pays &pound;2 per acre for annually to his
landlord.&nbsp; The hedge, however wide-bottomed, is his fence; and
fencing he must have.&nbsp; But these trees, arising at narrow intervals
from the hedge, and spreading out their deadening shades upon his wheatfields
on either side, are not useful nor ornamental to him.&nbsp; They may
look prettily, and make a nice picture in the eyes of the sentimental
tourist or traveller, but he grudges the ground they cover.&nbsp; He
could well afford to pay the landlord an additional rentage per annum
more than equal to the money value of the yearly growth of these trees.&nbsp;
Besides, the landlord has, in all probability, a large park of trees
around his mansion, and perhaps compact plantations on land unsuited
to agriculture.&nbsp; Thus the high value of these hedge-row trees around
the fields of his tenant, which he will realise on the spot, together
with some additional pounds in rent annually to himself and heirs, would
probably facilitate this levelling arrangement in face of all the restrictions
that the law of entail might seem to throw in the way.</p>
<p>If, therefore, the hedges of England disappear before the noiseless
and furtive progress of utilitarian science, the trees that rise above
them in such picturesque ranks will be almost certain to go with them.&nbsp;
Then, indeed, a change will come over the face of the country, which
will make it difficult for one to recognise it who daguerreotyped its
most beautiful features upon his memory before they were obliterated
by these latter-day &ldquo;improvements.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p><i>A FOOTPATH WALK AND ITS INCIDENTS&mdash;HARVEST ASPECTS&mdash;ENGLISH
AND AMERICAN SKIES&mdash;HUMBLER OBJECTS OF CONTEMPLATION&mdash;THE
DONKEY: ITS USES AND ABUSES.</i></p>
<p>Immediately after breakfast the following morning, my kind host accompanied
me for a mile on my walk, and put me on a footpath across the fields,
by which I might save a considerable distance on the way to Saffron
Walden, where I proposed to spend the Sabbath.&nbsp; After giving me
minute directions as to the course I was to follow, he bade me good-bye,
and I proceeded on at a brisk pace through fields of wheat and clover,
greatly enjoying the scenery, the air, and exercise.&nbsp; Soon I came
to a large field quite recently ploughed up <i>clean</i>, footpath and
all.&nbsp; Seeing a gate at each of the opposite corners, I made my
way across the furrows to the one at the left, as it seemed to be more
in the direction indicated by my host.&nbsp; There the path was again
broad and well-trodden, and I followed it through many fields of grain
yellowing to the harvest, until it opened into the main road.&nbsp;
This bore a little more to the left than I expected, but, as I had never
travelled it before, I believed it was all right.&nbsp; Thaxted was
half way to Saffron Walden, and there I had intended to stop an hour
or two for dinner and rest, then push on to the end of the day&rsquo;s
walk as speedily as possible.&nbsp; At about noon, I came suddenly down
upon the town, which seemed remarkably similar to the one I had left,
in size, situation, and general features.&nbsp; The parish church, also,
bore a strong resemblance to the one I had noticed the previous evening.&nbsp;
These old Essex towns are &ldquo;as much alike as two peas,&rdquo; and
you must make a note of it, as Captain Cuttle says, was the thought
first suggested by the coincidence.&nbsp; I went into a cosy, clean-faced
inn on the main street, and addressed myself with much satisfaction
to a short season of rest and refreshment, exchanging hot and dusty
boots for slippers, and going through other preliminaries to a comfortable
time of it.&nbsp; Rang the bell for dinner, but before ordering it,
asked the waiting-maid, with a complacent idea that I had improved my
walking pace, and made more than half the way&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How far is it to Saffron Walden?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twelve miles, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twelve miles, indeed!&nbsp; Why, it is only twelve miles from
Great Bardfield!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, this is Great Bardfield, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great Bardfield!&nbsp; What!&nbsp; How is this?&nbsp; What
do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She meant what she said, and it was as true as two and two make four;
and she was not to be beaten out of it by a stare of astonishment, however
a discomfited man might expand his eyes with wonder, or cloud his face
with chagrin.&nbsp; It was a patent fact.&nbsp; There, on the opposite
side of the street, was the house in which I slept the night before;
and here, just coming up to the door of the inn, was the good lady of
my host.&nbsp; Her form and voice, and other identifications dispelled
the mist of the mistake; and it came out as clear as day that I had
followed the direction of my host, to bear to the left, far too liberally,
and that I had been walking at my best speed in a &ldquo;vicious circle&rdquo;
for full two hours and a half, and had landed just where I commenced,
at least within the breadth of a narrow street of the same point.</p>
<p>My good friends urged me to stop and dine with them, and then make
a fair start for the end of my week&rsquo;s journey.&nbsp; But it was
still twelve miles to Saffron Walden, and I was determined to put half
of them behind me before dinner.&nbsp; So, taking a second leave of
them in the course of three hours, I set out again on my walk, a wiser
man in the practical understanding of the proverb, &ldquo;The longest
way around is the shortest way there.&rdquo;&nbsp; At 2 p.m.&nbsp; I
reached Thaxted, and rectified my first notion of the town, formed when
I mistook it for Bardfield.&nbsp; Having made six miles extra between
the two points, I resumed my walk after a short delay at the latter.</p>
<p>The weather was glorious.&nbsp; A cloudless sun shone upon a little
sky-crystalled world of beauty, smaller in every dimension than you
ever see in America.&nbsp; And this is a feature of English scenery
that will strike the American traveller most impressively at the first
glance, whether he looks at it by night or day.&nbsp; It is not that
Nature, in adjusting the symmetries of her scenic structures, nicely
apportions the skyscape to the landscape of a country merely for artistic
effect.&nbsp; It is not because the island of Great Britain is so small
in circumference that the sky is proportioned to it, as the crystal
is to the dial of a watch; that it is so apparently low; that the stars
it holds to its moist, blue bosom are so near at midnight, and the sun
so large at noon.&nbsp; It comes, doubtless, from that constant humidity
of the atmosphere which distinguishes the climate of England, and gives
to both land and sky an aspect which is quite unknown to our great western
continent.&nbsp; An American, after having habituated himself to this
aspect, on returning to his own country, will be almost surprised at
a feature of its scenery which he never noticed before.&nbsp; He will
be struck at the loftiness of the sky; at the vividness of its blue
and gold, the sharp, unsoftened light of the stars, and, as it were,
the contracted pupil of the sun&rsquo;s eye at mid-day.&nbsp; The sunset
glories of our western heavens play upon a ground of rigid blue.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The Northern Lights,&rdquo; which, at their winter evening illuminations,
seem to have shredded into wavy filaments all the rainbows that have
spanned the chambers of the East since the Flood, and to upspring, in
mirthful fantasy, to hang their infinitely-tinted tresses to the zenith&rsquo;s
golden diadem of stars&mdash;even they sport upon the same lofty concave
of dewless blue, which looks through and through the lacework and everchanging
drapery of their mingled hues in the most witching mazes of their nightly
waltz, giving to each a definiteness that our homely Saxon tongue might
fit with a name.</p>
<p>But here, on the lower grounds of instructive meditation, is a humbler
individuality of the country to notice.&nbsp; Here is the most sadly
abused and melancholy living creature in all England&rsquo;s animal
realm that meets me in the midst of these reflections on things supernal
and glorious.&nbsp; I will let the Northern Lights go, with their gorgeous
pantomimes and midnight revelries, and have a moment&rsquo;s communing
with this unfortunate quadruped.&nbsp; It is called in derision here
a &ldquo;<i>donkey</i>,&rdquo; but an ass, in a more generous time,
when one of his race and size bore upon his back into the Holy City
the world&rsquo;s Saviour and Re-Creator.&nbsp; Poor, libelled, hopeless
beast!&nbsp; I pity you from my heart&rsquo;s heart.&nbsp; How I wish
for Sterne&rsquo;s pen to do you some measure of justice or condolence
under this heavy load of opprobrium that bends your back and makes your
life so sunless and bitter!&nbsp; Come here, sir!&mdash;here is a biscuit
for you, of the finest wheat; few of your race get such morsels; so,
eat it and be thankful.&nbsp; What ears!&nbsp; No wonder our friend
Patrick called you &ldquo;the father of all rabbits&rdquo; at first
sight.&nbsp; No! don&rsquo;t turn away your head, as if I were going
to strike you.</p>
<p>Most animals are best described from a certain point of <i>view</i>,&mdash;in
a fixed and quiescent attitude.&nbsp; But the donkey should be taken
in the very act of this characteristic motion.&nbsp; You put out your
hand in the gentlest manner to pat any one of them you meet, and he
will instinctively turn away his head for fear of a beating.</p>
<p>There is an interesting speculation now coming up among modern reveries
in regard to the immortality of certain animals of great intelligence
and domestic virtues.&nbsp; A large and tender kindness of disposition
is the father of the thought, it may be; but the thought seems to gain
ground and take shape, that so much of apparently human mind and heart
as the dog possesses cannot be destined to annihilation at his death,
but must live and enlarge in another sphere of existence.&nbsp; Having
thus opened, if it may be said reverently, a back-door into immortality
for sagacious and affectionate dogs and horses, they leave it ajar for
the admission of animals of less intelligence&mdash;even for all the
kinds that Noah took into the ark, perhaps, although the theory is still
nebulous and undefined.&nbsp; Now, I would beg the kind-hearted adherents
to this theory not to think I am seeking to play off a satirical pleasantry
upon it, if I express a hope, which is earnest and true, that, if there
be an immortality for any class of dumb animals, the donkey shall go
into it first, and have a better place in it than their parlor dogs
or nicely-groomed horses.&nbsp; Evidently they are building up a claim
to this illustrious distinction of another existence for these pets
on the sole ground of merit, not of works, even, but of mere intelligence,
fidelity, and affection.&nbsp; Granted; but the donkey should go in
first and take the highest place on that basis.&nbsp; When you come
to the standard of moral measurement, it may be claimed as among the
highest of human as well as animal virtues, &ldquo;to learn to suffer
and be strong.&rdquo;&nbsp; And this virtue the donkey has learned and
practised incomparably beyond any other creature that ever walked on
four legs since the Flood.&nbsp; Let these good people remember that
their fanciful and romantic favoritisms are not to rule in the destinies
awarded to the infinitesimally human spirits of domestic animals in
another world, if another be in reserve for them.&nbsp; Let them remember
that their softly-cushioned dogs, and horses so delicately clad, and
fed, and fondled, have had a pretty good time of it in this life, and
that in another, the poor, despised, abused donkey, going about begging,
with such a long and melancholy face, for withered cabbage leaves and
woody-grained turnips cast out and trodden under feet of happier animals,&mdash;that
this meek little creature, kicked, cuffed, and club-beaten all the way
from hopeless youth to an ignominious grave, will carry into another
world merits and mementoes of his earthly lot that will obtain, if not
entitle him to, some compensation in the award of a future condition.&nbsp;
It is treading on delicate ground even to set one foot within the pale
of their unscriptural theory; but as many of them hold the Christian
faith in pureness of living and doctrine, let me remind them of that
parable which shows so impressively how the disparities in human condition
here are reversed in the destinies of the great hereafter.</p>
<p>But, to return to the earthly lot and position of this poor, libelled
animal.&nbsp; Among all the four-footed creatures domesticated to the
service of man, this has always been the veriest scapegoat and victim
of the cruellest and crabbedest of human dispositions.&nbsp; Truly,
it has ever been born unto sorrow, bearing all its life long a weight
of abuse and contumely which would break the heart of a less sensitive
animal in a single week.&nbsp; From the beginning it has been the poor
man&rsquo;s beast of burden; and &ldquo;pity &rsquo;tis &rsquo;tis true,&rdquo;
poor men, in all the generations of human poverty, have been far too
prone to harshness of temper and treatment towards the beasts that serve
them and share their lot of humble life.&nbsp; The donkey is made a
kind of Ishmaelite in the great family of domestic animals.&nbsp; He
is made, not born so.&nbsp; He is beaten about the head unmercifully
with a heavy stick, and then jeered at for being stupid and obstinate!
just as if any other creature, of four or two legs, would not be stupid
after such fierce congestion of the brain.&nbsp; His long ears subject
him to a more cruel prejudice than ever color engendered in the circle
of humanity but just above him.&nbsp; True, he is rather unsymmetrical
in form.&nbsp; His head is disproportionately long and large, quite
sufficient in these dimensions to fit a camel.&nbsp; He is generally
a hollow-backed, pot-bellied creature, about the size of a yearling
calf, with ungainly, sloping haunches, and long, coarse hair.&nbsp;
But nearly all these deformities come out of the shameful treatment
he gets.&nbsp; You occasionally meet one that might hold up its head
in any animal society; with straight back, symmetrical body and limbs,
and hair as soft and sleek as the fur of a Maltese cat; with contented
face, and hopeful and happy eyes, showing that he has a kind master.</p>
<p>The donkey is really a useful and valuable animal, which might be
introduced into America with great advantage to our farmers.&nbsp; I
know of no animal of its size so tough and strong.&nbsp; It is astonishing,
as well as shocking, to see what loads he is made to draw here.&nbsp;
The vehicle to which he is usually harnessed is a heavy, solid affair,
frequently as large as our common horse-carts.&nbsp; He is put to all
kinds of work, and is almost exclusively the poor man&rsquo;s beast
of burden and travel.&nbsp; In cities and large towns, his cart is loaded
with the infinitely-varied wares of street trade; with cabbages, fish,
fruit, or with some of the thousand-and-one nicknacks that find a market
among the masses of the common people.&nbsp; At watering-places, or
on the &ldquo;commons&rdquo; or suburban playgrounds of large towns,
he is brought out in a handsome saddle, or a well got-up little carriage,
and let by the hour or by the ride to invalid adults, or to children
bubbling over with life.&nbsp; Here, although the everlasting club,
to which he is born, is wielded by his driver, he often looks comfortable
and sleek, and sometimes wears a red ribbon at each ear.&nbsp; It would
not pay to bring on to the ground the scrawny, bony creature that generally
tugs in the costermonger&rsquo;s cart.&nbsp; It is in the coal region
or trade that you meet with him and his driver in their worst apostacy
from all that is seemly in man or beast.&nbsp; To watch the poor creature,
begrimed with coal-dust, wriggling up a long, steep hill, with a load
four times his own weight, griping with his little sheep-footed hoofs
into the black, slimy pavement of the road, while his tall, sooty-faced
and harsh-voiced master, perhaps sitting on the top or on a shaft, is
punching and beating him; to see this is enough to stir up the old adam
in the meekest Christian to emotions of pugilistic indignation.&nbsp;
It has often cost me a doubtful and protracted effort to keep it down.&nbsp;
Indeed, I have often yielded to it so far as to wish that once more
the poor creature might be honored of God with His gift to Balaam&rsquo;s
ass, and be able to speak, bolt outright, an indignant remonstrance,
in human speech, against such treatment.&nbsp; It would serve them right!&mdash;these
lineal descendants of Balaam, who have inherited his club and wield
it more cruelly.</p>
<p>A word or two more about this animal, and I will pass on to others
of more dignity of position.&nbsp; He is the cheapest as well as smallest
beast of burden to be found in Christendom.&nbsp; You may buy one here
for twenty or thirty English shillings.&nbsp; I am confident that they
would be extremely serviceable in America, if once introduced.&nbsp;
It costs but very little to keep them, and they will do all kinds of
work up to the draught of 600 or 800 lbs.&nbsp; You frequently see here
a span of them trotting off in a cart, with brisk and even step.&nbsp;
Sometimes they are put on as leaders to a team of horses.&nbsp; I once
saw on my walk a heavy Lincolnshire horse in the shafts, a pony next,
and a donkey at the head, making a team graduated from 18 hands to 6
in height; and all pulling evenly, and apparently keeping step with
each other, notwithstanding the disparity in the length of their legs.</p>
<p>It would be unjust to that goodwill to man and beast which is being
organised and stimulated in England through an infinite number of societies,
if I should omit to state that, at last, a little rill of this benevolence
has reached the donkey.&nbsp; That most valuable and widely-circulated
penny magazine, &ldquo;The British Workman,&rdquo; and its little companion
for British workmen&rsquo;s children, &ldquo;The Band of Hope Review,&rdquo;
have advocated the rights and better treatment of this humble domestic
for several years.&nbsp; His cause has also been pleaded in a packet
of little papers called &ldquo;Leaflets of the Law of Kindness for the
Children.&rdquo;&nbsp; And now, at last, a wealthy and benevolent champion,
on whom the mantle of Elizabeth Fry, his aunt, has fallen, has taken
the lead in the work of raising the useful creature to the level of
the other animals of the pasture, stable, and barn-yard.&nbsp; Up to
the present time, every creature that walks on four or two legs, either
haired, woolled, or feathered, with the single exception of the donkey
has had the door of the Agricultural Exhibition thrown wide open to
it, to enter the lists for prizes or &ldquo;honorable mention,&rdquo;
and for general admiration.&nbsp; A pig, whose legs and eyes have all
been absorbed out of sight by an immense rotundity of fat, is often
decked with a ribbon, of the Order of the Garter genus, as a reward
of merit, or of grace of form and proportions!&nbsp; Turkeys, geese,
ducks, and hens of different breeds, strut or waddle off with similar
distinctions.&nbsp; As for blood-horses, bulls, cows, and sheep, one
not versed in such matters might be tempted to think that men, especially
the poorer sort, were made for beasts, and not beasts for men.&nbsp;
And yet, <i>mirabile dictu</i>! at these great social gatherings of
man-and-animal kind, there has not been even &ldquo;a negro-pew&rdquo;
for the donkey.&nbsp; A genuine, raw, Guinea negro might have as well
entered the Prince of Wales&rsquo; Ball in New York bare-footed, and
offered to play a voluntary on his banjo for the dancers, as this despised
quadruped have hoped to obtain the <i>entree</i> to these grand and
fashionable assemblies of the shorter-eared <i>elite</i> of society.</p>
<p>But this prejudice against color and long ears is now going the way
of other barbarisms.&nbsp; The gentleman to whom I have referred, a
Member of Parliament, whose means are as large as his benevolence, has
taken the first and decisive step towards raising the donkey to his
true place in society.&nbsp; He has offered a liberal prize for the
best conditioned one exhibited at the next Agricultural Fair.&nbsp;
Since this offer was made, a very decided improvement has been noticed
among the donkeys of the London costermongers, as if the competition
for the first prize was to be a very large one.</p>
<p>It will be a kind of St. Crispin&rsquo;s Day to the whole of the
long-eared race&mdash;a day of emancipation from forty centuries of
obloquy and oppression.&nbsp; Doubtless they will be admitted hereafter
to the Royal Agricultural Society&rsquo;s exhibitions, to compete for
honors with animals that have hitherto spurned such association with
contempt.</p>

COUNTRY INNS; THEIR APPEARANCE, NAMES, AND DISTINCTIVE CHARACTERISTICS&mdash;THE

COMFORTS.</i></p>
<p>I reached Saffron Walden at 4 p.m., notwithstanding my involuntary
walk of six extra miles in the morning.&nbsp; Here I remained over the
Sabbath, again enjoying the hospitality of a Friend.&nbsp; And perhaps
I may say it here and now with as much propriety as at any other time
and place, that few persons, outside the pale of that society, have
more frequently or fully enjoyed that hospitality than myself.&nbsp;
This pleasant experience has covered the space of more than sixteen
years.&nbsp; During this period, with the exception of short intervals,
I have been occupied with movements which the Friends in England have
always regarded with especial sympathy.&nbsp; This connection has brought
me into acquaintance with members of the society in almost every town
in Great Britain in which they reside; and in more than a hundred of
their homes I have been received as a guest with a kindness which will
make to my life&rsquo;s end one of its sunniest memories.</p>
<p>On the following Monday, I resumed my walk northward, after a carriage
ride which a Friend kindly gave me for a few miles on the way.&nbsp;
Passed through a pre-eminently grain-producing district.&nbsp; Apparently
full three-fourths of the land were covered with wheat, barley, oats,
and beans.&nbsp; The fields of each were larger than I had noticed before;
some containing 100 acres.&nbsp; The coming harvest is putting forth
the full glory of its golden promise.&nbsp; The weather is all a farmer
could wish, beautiful, warm, and bright.&nbsp; Nature, in every feature
of its various scapes, seems to smile with the joy of that human happiness
which her ministries inspire.&nbsp; Here, in these still expanses, waving
with luxuriant crops, apparently so thinly peopled, one, forgetting
the immense populations crowded into city spaces, is almost tempted
to ask, where are all the mouths to eat this wide sea of food for man
and beast, softening so gently into a yellow sheen under the very rim
of the distant horizon?&nbsp; But, in the great heart of London, beating
with the wants of millions, he will be likely to reverse the question,
and ask, where can one buy bread wherewith to feed this great multitude?</p>
<p>At Sawston, a rustic little village on the southern border of Cambridgeshire,
I entered upon the enjoyment of English country-inn life with that relish
which no one born in a foreign land can so fully feel as an American.&nbsp;
As one looks upon the living face of some distinguished celebrity for
the first time, after having had his portrait hung up in the parlor
for twenty years, so an American looks, for the first time, at that
great and picturesque speciality among human institutions, the village
inn of old England.&nbsp; The like of it he never saw in his own country
and never will.&nbsp; In fact, he would not like to see it there, plucked
up out of its ancient histories and associations.&nbsp; In the ever-green
foliage of these it stands inwoven, as with its own network of ivy.&nbsp;
Other countries, even older than England, have had their taverns from
time immemorial; but they are all kept in the background of human life.&nbsp;
They do not come out in contemporaneous history with any definiteness;
not even accidentally.&nbsp; If a king is murdered in one of them, or
if it is the theatre of the most thrilling romance of love, you do not
know whether it is a building of stone, brick, or wood; whether it is
one, two, or three stories in height.&nbsp; No outlines nor aspects
are given you to help to fill up a rational picture of it.&nbsp; Neither
the landlord nor the landlady is drawn as a representative man or woman.&nbsp;
Either might be mistaken for a guest in their own house, if seen in
hat or bonnet by a stranger.</p>
<p>But not so of the English country inn.&nbsp; It comes out into the
foreground of a thousand interesting histories and pictures of common
life.&nbsp; In them it has an individuality as marked as the parish
church, <i>couchante</i> in its wide-rimmed nest of grave stones; as
marked in unique architecture, location, and surroundings.&nbsp; In
none of these features will you find two alike, if you travel from one
end of the country to the other; especially among those a century old.&nbsp;
You might as well mistake one of the living animals for the other, as
to mistake &ldquo;The Blue Boar&rdquo; for &ldquo;The Red Lion.&rdquo;&nbsp;
They differ as much from each other in general make and aspect as do
their nominal prototypes.&nbsp; To give every one of their thousands
&ldquo;a local habitation and a name&rdquo; of striking distinctness,
has required an ingenuity which has produced many interesting feats
of house-building and nomenclature.&nbsp; Both these departments of
genius figure largely in the poetry and classics of the institution,
with which the reading million of America have been familiar from youth
up.&nbsp; And when any of them come to travel in England, it will greatly
enhance their enjoyment to find that the pictures they have admired
and the descriptions they have read of the famous country inn have been
true to the very life and letter.&nbsp; All its salient features they
recognise at once, and are ready to exclaim, &ldquo;How natural!&rdquo;
meaning by that, how true is the original to the picture which they
have seen so frequently.&nbsp; If they go far enough, they will find
the very original of every one of the hundred pictures they have seen,
painted by pen or pencil.&nbsp; They will find that all of them have
been true copies from nature.&nbsp; Here is the portly-looking, well-to-do,
two-story tavern, standing out with its comfortable, cream-colored face
broadside to the street.&nbsp; It is represented in the old engraving
with a coach-and-four drawn up before the door, surrounded by a crowd
of spectators and passengers, some descending and ascending on ladders
over the forward wheels; some looking with admiration at the scarlet
coats of the pursy and consequential driver and guard; some exchanging
greetings, others farewell salutations; ostlers in long waistcoats,
plush or fustian shorts, and yellow leggings, standing bareheaded with
watering-pails at the &ldquo;&rsquo;osses&rsquo; &rsquo;eads;&rdquo;
trunks great and small going up and down; village boys in high excitement;
village grandfathers looking very animated; the landlord, burly, bland,
and happy, with a face as rotund and genial as the full moon shining
upon the scene; and those round, rosy, sunny, laughing faces peering
out of the windows with delightful wonderment and exhilaration, winked
at by the driver, and saluted with a graceful motion of his whip-handle
in recognition of the barmaid, chambermaid, and all the other maids
of the house.&nbsp; The coach, with all its picturesque appointments,
its four-in-hand, the stirring heraldry of its horn coming down the
road, its rattling wheels, the life and stir aroused and moved in its
wake,&mdash;all this has gone from the presence of a higher civilisation.&nbsp;
It will never re-appear in future pictures of actual life in England.&nbsp;
It is all gone where the hedges and hedge-row trees will probably go
in their turn.&nbsp; But the same village inn remains, and can be as
easily recognised as a widow in weeds, who still wears a hopeful face,
and makes the best of her bereavement.</p>
<p>But that humbler type of hostelry so often represented in sketches
of English rural life and scenery&mdash;the little, cozy, one-story,
wayside, or hamlet inn, with its thatched roof, checker-work window,
low door, and with a loaded hay-cart standing in front of it, while
the driver, in his round, wool hat, and in his smock-frock, is drinking
at a pewter mug of beer, with one hand on his horse&rsquo;s neck&mdash;this
the hand of modern improvements has not yet reached.&nbsp; This may
be found still in a thousand villages and hamlets, surrounded with all
its rural associations; the green, the geese, and gray donkeys feeding
side by side; low-jointed cottages, with long, sloping roofs greened
over with moss or grass, and other objects usually shadowed dimly in
the background of the picture.&nbsp; It is these quiet hamlets and houses
in the still depths of the country, away from the noise and bluster
of railway life and motion, that best represent and perpetuate the primeval
characteristics of a nation.&nbsp; These the American traveller will
find invested with all the old charm with which his fancy clothed them.&nbsp;
It will well repay him for a month&rsquo;s walk to see and enjoy them
thoroughly.</p>
<p>In these days of sun-literature, whose letters are human faces, and
whose new volumes are numbered by the million yearly, without a duplicate
to one of them, I am confident that a volume of these English village
inns of the olden school, in photographs, would command a large sale
and admiration in America, merely as specimens of unique and interesting
architecture.&nbsp; A thousand might be taken, every one as unlike the
other in distinctive form and feature, as every one of the same number
of men would be to the other.</p>
<p>The diversification of names, being more difficult, is still more
remarkable.&nbsp; Although the spread eagle figures largely as the patron
genius of American hotels, still nine-tenths of them bear the names
of states, counties, towns, or national or local celebrities.&nbsp;
But here natural history comes out strong and wide.&nbsp; The heraldry
of sovereigns, aristocracy, gentry, commercial and industrial interests,
puts up its various <i>arms</i> upon hundreds of inns in town and country.&nbsp;
All occupations and recreations are well represented.&nbsp; Thus no
country in the world approaches England in the wide scope and play of
hotel nomenclature.&nbsp; Some of the combinations are exceedingly unique
and most interesting in their incongruity.&nbsp; Dickens has not exaggerated
this characteristic; not even done it justice in his hotel scenes.&nbsp;
Things are put together on a hundred tavern signs that were never joined
before in the natural or moral world, and put together frequently in
most grotesque association.&nbsp; For instance, there is a large, first-class
inn right in the very heart of London, which has for a sign, not painted
on a board, but let into the wall of the upper story, in solid statuary,
a huge human mouth opened to its utmost capacity, and a bull, round
and plump, standing stoutly on its four legs between the two distended
jaws.&nbsp; Now, the leading idea of this device is involved in a tempting
obscurity, which leads one, at first sight, into different lines of
conjecture.&nbsp; What did the designer of this group of statuary really
intend to represent?&nbsp; Was it to let the outside world know that,
in that inn, the &ldquo;Roast Beef of Old England&rdquo; was always
to be found <i>par excellence</i>?&nbsp; If so, would a man&rsquo;s
mouth swallowing a bull whole, and apparently alive, with hide and horns,
tend to stimulate the appetite of a passing traveller, and to draw him
into the establishment?&nbsp; But leaving these ambiguous symbols to
be interpreted by the passing public according to different perceptions
of their meaning, how many in a thousand would guess aright the name
given to the tavern by these tokens?&nbsp; Would not ninety-nine in
a hundred say, &ldquo;The Mouth and Bull,&rdquo; to be sure, not only
on the principle that the major includes the minor, but also because
the human element is entitled to precedence in the picture?&nbsp; But
the ninety-nine would be completely mistaken, if they adopted this natural
conclusion.&nbsp; They would find they had counted without their host,
who knows better than they the relative position and value of things.&nbsp;
What has the law of logic to do with fat beef?&nbsp; The name of his
famous hotel is &ldquo;THE BULL AND MOUTH;&rdquo; and few in London
have attained to its celebrity as a historical building.&nbsp; One is
apt to wonder if this precedence given to the beast is really incidental,
or adopted to give euphony to the name of an inn, or whether there is
a latent and spontaneous leaning to such a method of association, from
some cause or other connected with perceptions of personal comfort afforded
at such establishments.&nbsp; Accidental or intentional, this form of
association is very common.&nbsp; There is no tavern in London better
known than <i>The Elephant and Castle</i>, a designation that would
sound equally well if the two substantives were transposed.&nbsp; Even
the loftiest symbols of sovereignty often occupy the secondary place
in these compound titles.&nbsp; There are, doubtless, a hundred inns
in Great Britain bearing the name of <i>The Rose and Crown</i>, but
not one, to my knowledge, called &ldquo;The Crown and Rose.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The same order obtains in sporting sections and terminology.&nbsp; It
is always &ldquo;The <i>Hare</i> and Hounds;&rdquo; never &ldquo;<i>Hounds</i>
and Hare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This characteristic in itself is very interesting, and no American,
with an eye to the unique, would like to see it changed.&nbsp; But if
the more syntax of hotel names in England is so pleasant for him to
study, how much more admirable is their variety!&nbsp; He has read at
home of many of them in lively romance and grave history but he finds
here that not half has been told him.&nbsp; He is familiar with the
Lions, Red, White, and Black; the Bulls and Boars of the same colors;
the Black and White Swans and Harts; the Crown and Anchor, the Royal
George, Queen&rsquo;s Head, and a few others of similar designation.&nbsp;
These names have figured in volumes of English literature which he has
perused.&nbsp; But let him travel on the turnpike road through country
towns and villages, and he will meet with names he never thought of
before, mounted over the doors of some of the most comfortable and delightful
houses of entertainment for man and beast that can be found in the world.&nbsp;
Here are a few that I have noticed: &ldquo;The Three Jolly Butchers,&rdquo;
&ldquo;The Old Mash Tub,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Old Mermaid,&rdquo; &ldquo;The
Old Malt Shovel,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Chequers,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Dog-in-Doublet,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Bishop Boniface,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Spotted Cow,&rdquo; &ldquo;The
Green Dragon,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Three Horseshoes,&rdquo; &ldquo;The
Bird-in-Hand,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Spare Rib,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Old Cock,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Pop goes the Weasel.&rdquo;&nbsp; There are wide spaces between
these names which may be filled up from actual life with numbers of
equal uniqueness.&nbsp; But it is not in architecture nor in name that
the country inn presents its most attractive characteristic.&nbsp; These
features merely specialise its outward corporeity.&nbsp; The living,
brightening, all-pervading soul of the establishment is the LANDLADY.&nbsp;
Let her name be written in capitals evermore.&nbsp; There is nothing
so naturally, speakingly, and gloriously English in the wide world as
she.&nbsp; It is doubtful if the nation is aware of this, but it is
the fact.&nbsp; Her English individuality stands out <i>embonpoint</i>,
rosy, genial, self-complacent, calm, serene, happyfying, and happy.&nbsp;
She is the man and master of the house.&nbsp; She permeates it with
her rayful presence, and fills it with a pleasant morning in foggy and
blue-spirited days.&nbsp; She it is who greets the coming and speeds
the parting guest with a grace which suns, with equal light and warmth,
both remembrance and anticipation.&nbsp; It is not put on like a Sunday
dress; it is not a thin gloss of French politeness that a feather, blown
the wrong way, will brush off.&nbsp; It is not a color; it is a quality.&nbsp;
You see it breathe and move in her like a nature, not as an art.&nbsp;
Let no American traveller fancy he has seen England if he has not seen
the Landlady of the village inn.&nbsp; If he has to miss one, he had
better give up his visit to the Crystal Palace, Stratford-upon-Avon,
Abbottsford, or even the House of Lords, or Windsor itself.&nbsp; Neither
is so perfectly and exclusively English as the mistress of &ldquo;The
Brindled Cow,&rdquo; in one of the rural counties of the kingdom.</p>
<p>It would be necessary to coin a new word if one were sought to contain
and convey the distinctive characteristic of inn-life in England.&nbsp;
Perhaps <i>homefulness</i> would do this best, as it would more fully
than any other term describe the coziness, quiet, and comfort to be
enjoyed at these places of entertainment.&nbsp; Not one in a hundred
of them ever heard the sound of the hotel-going bell, as we hear it
in America.&nbsp; You are not thundered up or down by a vociferous gong.&nbsp;
Then there is no marching nor counter-marching of a long line of waiters
in white jackets around the dinner table, laying down plate, knife,
fork, and spoon with uniform step and motion, as if going through a
dress-parade or a military drill.&nbsp; There is no bustle, no noise,
no eager nor anxious look of served or servants.&nbsp; Every one is
calm, collected, and comfortable.&nbsp; &ldquo;The cares that infest
the day&rdquo; do not ride into the presence of that roast beef and
plum pudding on the wrinkles of any man&rsquo;s forehead, however business
affairs may go with him outside.&nbsp; No one is in a hurry to sit down
or to arise from the table.&nbsp; The whole economy of the establishment
is to make you as much at home as possible; to individualise you, as
far as it can be done, in every department of personal comfort.&nbsp;
You follow your own time and inclination, and eat and drink when and
how you please, with others or alone.&nbsp; The congregate system is
the exception, not the rule.&nbsp; It seldom ever obtains at breakfast
or tea.&nbsp; In many cases you have a little round table all to yourself
at these meals.&nbsp; But if there is a common table for half a dozen
persons, the tea and toast and other eatables are never aggregated into
a common stock.&nbsp; Each person if he is a single guest, has his own
allotment, even to a separate tea-pot.&nbsp; The <i>table d&rsquo;hote</i>,
if there be one at all, is made up like a select dinner party, rather
early in the morning.&nbsp; If the guests of the house are not directly
invited, they are asked, in a tone of hospitality, if they will join
in the social meal, the only one got up by the establishment at which
the table is not mapped out in separate holdings, or little independencies
of dishes, each bounded by the wants and capacities of the individual
occupant.</p>
<p>The presiding and working faculty of a common English inn distinguishes
it by another salient characteristic from the hotels of other countries.&nbsp;
The landlady is, of course, the president of the establishment, whether
or not she calls any man lord in the retired and family department of
the house.&nbsp; But the actual <i>gerantes</i>, or working corps, with
which you have to do immediately, are three independent and distinct
personages, called the waiter, chambermaid, and <i>boots</i>.&nbsp;
If it were respectful to gender, these might be called the great triumvirate
of the English inn.&nbsp; No traveller after a night&rsquo;s lodging
and breakfast, will mistake or confound the prerogatives or perquisites
of these officials.&nbsp; If he is an American, and it be his first
experience of the <i>regime</i>, he will be surprised and puzzled at
the <i>imperium in imperio</i> which his bill, presented to him on a
tea-tray, seems to represent.&nbsp; In no other business transaction
of his life did he ever see the like.&nbsp; It goes far beyond anything
in the line of limited partnership he ever saw.&nbsp; There is only
one partial parallel that approaches it; and this comes to his mind
as he reads the several items on his bill.&nbsp; When made out and interpreted,
it comes to this: the proprietor, the waiter, chambermaid, and boots
are independent parties, who get up a night&rsquo;s lodging and two
or three meals for you on the same footing as four independent underwriters
would take proportionate risks at Lloyd&rsquo;s in some ship at sea.&nbsp;
Or, what would put it in simpler form to an uninitiated guest, he is
apparently first charged for the raw provisions he consumes, and for
the rent of his bed-room.&nbsp; This is the proprietor&rsquo;s share.&nbsp;
Then, there is a separate charge for each of the remaining items of
the entertainment,&mdash;for cooking and serving up each meal, for making
up your bed, and for blacking your boots; just as distinctly as if you
had gone out into the town the previous evening and hired three separate
individuals to perform these services for you; and as if you had no
right nor reason to expect from the landlord a dinner all cooked and
served, but that you only bought it in the larder.</p>
<p>Now, this is a peculiarity of the English hotel system that is apt
to embarrass travellers from other countries, especially from America,
where no such custom could be introduced.&nbsp; I do not know how old
the custom is in Great Britain.&nbsp; Doubtless it originated in the
almost universal disposition and habit of Englishmen of dropping gratuities
or charity-gifts here and there with liberal hand, either to obtain
or reward extra service in matters of personal comfort, or to alleviate
some case of actual or stimulated suffering that meets them.&nbsp; It
was natural and inevitable that gratuities thus given to hotel servants
frequently to stimulate and reward special attention should soon become
a rule, acting upon guests like a law of honor.&nbsp; When so many gave,
and when the servants of every hotel expected a gift, a man must feel
shabby to go away without dropping a few pennies into the hands of eager
expectants who almost claimed the gratuity as a right.&nbsp; The worst
stage of the system was when the expected gift was measured by your
supposed position and ability, or when the waiter or the chambermaid,
flattering you with what Falstaff would call an instinctive perception
of your dignity, would say with an asking and hopeful smile, &ldquo;What
you please, sir.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now, that was not the question with you
at all.&nbsp; You wanted to know how much each expected, or how much
you must give to acquit yourself of the charge of being &ldquo;a screw,&rdquo;
when they put their heads and gains together in conference and comparison
after you were gone.&nbsp; So, on the whole, it was a great relief when
all these awkward uncertainties of expectation were cleared up and rectified
in the system now usually adopted.</p>
<p>Whether you be rich or poor, or whatever position or pretension be
attributed to you, the fees of the universal triumvirate are put down
specifically in black and white among the other charges on your bill.&nbsp;
As I hope these notes may convey some useful information to Americans
who may be about to visit England for the first time, it may be of some
use to them to state what is the usual rule in this matter at the middle-class
hotels in this country; for with those of the first rank I never have
made nor ever expect to make any personal acquaintance.&nbsp; A moderate
bill for a day&rsquo;s entertainment will read thus:&mdash;</p>
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;s.d.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Total&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 8 0</pre>
<p>These are about the average charges at the middle-class hotels in
Great Britain.&nbsp; Generally the servants&rsquo; fees amount to 25
per cent. of the whole bill.&nbsp; These, too, are graduated to parts
of days.&nbsp; The waiter expects 3d. for every meal he serves; the
chambermaid 6d. for every bed she makes, and the boots 3d. for doing
every pair of boots, brogans, or shoes.&nbsp; You will pay these charges
with all the better grace and good-will to these servants when you come
to learn that these fees frequently, if not always, constitute all the
salary they receive for hotel service.&nbsp; Even in a great number
of eating-shops the same rule obtains.&nbsp; The penny you give the
waiter, male or female, is all he or she gets for serving you.&nbsp;
Besides this consideration, you get back much additional personal comfort
from these extras.&nbsp; The waiter serves you with extra satisfaction
and assiduity under their stimulus.&nbsp; He acts the host very blandly.&nbsp;
He answers a hundred questions, extraneous to the meal, with good-natured
readiness.&nbsp; He is a good judge of the weather and its signs.&nbsp;
He is well &ldquo;posted-up&rdquo; in the local histories and sceneries
of the place.&nbsp; He can give political information on both sides,
incidents and anecdotes to match, whether you are Tory, Whig, or Radical.&nbsp;
If you have a bias in that direction, he has or has heard some thoughts
on Bishop Colenso and the Tractarians.&nbsp; In short, he caters to
the humour and disposition of every guest with a happy facility of adaptation;
and the shilling you give him at the end of a day&rsquo;s entertainment
has been pretty well earned, if you have availed yourself of all these
extra attentions which he is prepared and expecting to give for it.</p>
<p>The same may be said of the chambermaid.&nbsp; She is not the taciturn
invisible that steals in and out of your bed-room, and does it up when
you are at breakfast or at your out-door business&mdash;whom you never
see, except by sheer accident, as in the American hotel.&nbsp; She is
an important and prominent personage in the English inn.&nbsp; She is
a kind of mistress of the robes, and exercises her prerogative with
much conscious dignity and self-satisfaction; and, what is better, with
great satisfaction to yourself.&nbsp; No other subordinate official
or servant trenches or poaches upon her preserves.&nbsp; She it is who
precedes you up stairs with a candle, on a broad-bottomed brass candlestick,
polished to its highest lustre.&nbsp; She conducts you to your room
as if you were her personal guest, invited and expected a month ago.&nbsp;
She opens the door with amiable complacency, as if welcoming you to
a hospitality which she had prepared for you with especial care, before
she knew you had arrived in town.&nbsp; She invites you, by a movement
of her eyes, to glance at the room and see how comfortable it is; how
round and soft is the bed, how white and well-aired are the sheets and
pillows, how nice the curtains, how clean and tidy the carpet, in short,
how everything is fitted to incline you to &ldquo;rest and be thankful.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And then the cheery &ldquo;<i>good night</i>!&rdquo; she bids you is
said with a tone that is worth the sixpence she expects in the morning;
and you pay it, too, with a much better grace than could be expected
from an American recently arrived in the country.</p>
<p>And the &ldquo;boots&rdquo; is a character, too, unmixedly and interestingly
English, in name, person, appearance, and position.&nbsp; In the first
of these qualities he is unique, being called after the subject of his
occupation.&nbsp; He is an important personage, and generally has his
own bell in the dining-room, surmounted by his name, to be called for
any service coming within his department.&nbsp; And this is quite a
wide one, including a great variety of errandry and porterage, as well
as polishing boots and shoes.&nbsp; He is very helpful in a great many
different ways, and often very intelligent, and knows all about the
streets, the railway trains, the omnibuses, cabs, etc., and will assist
you in such matters with good grace and activity.&nbsp; He may have
got in the way of putting the H before the eggs instead of the ham;
but he is just as good for all that, and more interesting besides.&nbsp;
So you do not grudge the 3d. you give him daily for his strictly professional
services, or the extra 6d. he expects for carrying your carpet-bag or
portmanteau to the railway-station.</p>
<p>Thus, although this feeing of servants may seem at first strange
to an American traveller in England, and may occasion him some perplexity
and even annoyance, he will soon become accustomed to it; and in making
up the balance-sheet of the additional cost on one side and the additional
comfort on the other which the system produces, he will come even to
the mathematical conclusion, &ldquo;if to equals you add equals, the
sums will be equals.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p><i>LIGHT OF HUMAN LIVES&mdash;PHOTOGRAPHS AND BIOGRAPHS&mdash;THE
LATE JONAS WEBB, HIS LIFE, LABORS, AND MEMORY.</i></p>
<p>The next morning I resumed my walk and visited a locality bearing
a name and association of world-wide celebrity and interest.&nbsp; It
is the name of a small rural hamlet, hardly large enough to be called
a village, and marked by no trait of nature or art to give it distinction.</p>
<p>There are conditions and characteristics both in the natural and
moral world which can hardly be described fully in Saxon, Latin, or
Greek terminology, even with the largest license of construction.&nbsp;
There are attributes or qualities attaching to certain locations, of
the simplest natural features, which cannot even be hinted at or suggested
by the terms, <i>geography, topography, or biography</i>.&nbsp; Put
the three together and condense or collocate their several meanings
in one compound qualification which you can write and another spell,
and you do not compass the signification you want to convey.&nbsp; The
soul of man has its immortality, and the feeblest-minded peasant believes
he shall wear it through the ages of the great hereafter.&nbsp; The
literature of human thoughts claims a life that shall endure as long
as the future existence of humanity.&nbsp; The memory of many human
actions and lives puts in a plea and promise of a duration that shall
distance the sun&rsquo;s, and overlap upon the bright centuries of eternity.&nbsp;
The human body, even, is promised its resurrection by the divinest authority
and illustration, and waits hopefully, under all its pains and weaknesses,
for the glory to be revealed in it when the earth on which it dwells
shall have become &ldquo;a forgotten circumstance.&rdquo;&nbsp; Human
loves, remembrances, faiths, and fellowships lift up all their meek
hands to the Father of Spirits, praying to be lifted up into His great
immortality, and to be permitted to take with them unbroken the associations
that sweetened this earthly life.&nbsp; Many humble souls that have
passed through the furnace of affliction, poverty, and trial seven times
heated, and heated daily here, have believed that He who went up through
the same suffering to His great White Throne, would let them sing beside
the crystal waters the same good old psalm tunes and songs of Sion which
they sang under the willows of this lower world of tears and tribulation.&nbsp;
How all the sparks of the undying life in man fly upward to the zenith
of this immortality!&nbsp; You may call the steep flights of this faith
pleasant and poetical diversions of a fervid imagination, but they are
winged with the pinions that angels lift when they soar; pinions less
ethereal than theirs, but formed and plumed to beat upward on the Milky
Way to their Source, instead of swimming in the thinly-starred cerulean,
in which spirits, never touched with the down or dust of human attributes,
descend and ascend on their missions to the earth.&nbsp; Who can have
the heart to handle harshly these beautiful faiths?&nbsp; To say, this
hope may go up, but this must go down to the darkness of annihilation!&nbsp;
Was it irreverent in the pious singing-master of a New England village,
when he said, that often, while returning home late on bright winter
nights, he had dropped the reins upon his horse&rsquo;s neck, and sung
Old Hundred from the stars, set as notes to that holy tune, when they
first sang together in the morning of the creation?&nbsp; What spiritual
good or Christian end would be gained, to break up the charm and cheer
of this his belief?&nbsp; Or to dispel that other confidence, which
so helped him to bear earth&rsquo;s trials, that one day he should join
all the spirits of the just made perfect, and all the high angels in
heaven, and, on the plane of that golden gamut, they should sing together
their hymns of joy and praise, in that same, good, old tune, from those
same star-notes, which a thousand centuries should not deflect nor transpose
from their first order within those everlasting staves and bars!</p>
<p>If the spirit&rsquo;s faith be allowed such wide confidences as these;
if it may carry up into the invisible and infinite so many precious
relics from the wreck of time, so many human circumstances and associations,
why may it not take with it, to hang up in its heaven, photographs of
those earthly localities rendered immortal here by the lives of good
and great men?&nbsp; Such a life is a sun, and it casts a disk of light
upon the very earth on which it shines; not that flashy circle which
the lens of the microscope casts upon the opposite wall, to show how
scarcely visible mites may be magnified; but a soft and steady illumination
that does not dim under the beating storms and bleaching dews of centuries,
but grows brighter and brighter, as if the seed-rays that made it first
multiplied themselves from year to year.&nbsp; The earth becomes more
and more thickly dotted with these permanent disks of light, and each
is visited by pilgrims, who go and stand with reverence and admiration
within the cheering circle.&nbsp; Shakespeare&rsquo;s thought-life threw
out a brilliant illumination, of wide circumference, at Stratford-upon-Avon,
and no locality in England bears a biograph more venerated than the
birth-place of the great poet.&nbsp; His thought-life was a sun that
will never set as long as this above us shines.&nbsp; It is rising every
year to new generations that never saw its rays before.&nbsp; When he
laid down his pen, at the end of his last drama, the whole English-speaking
race in both hemispheres did not number twice the present population
of London.&nbsp; Now, seventy-five millions, peopling mighty continents,
speak the tongue he raised to the grandest of all earth&rsquo;s speeches;
and those who people the antipodes claim to offer the best homage to
his genius.&nbsp; Thus it will go on to the end of time.&nbsp; As the
language he clothed with such power and might shall spread itself over
the earth, and be spoken, too, by races born to another tongue, his
life-rays will permeate the minds of countless myriads, and the more
widely they diverge and the farther they reach, the brighter and warmer
will be the glow and the flow of that disk of light that embosoms and
illumines his birth-place in England.</p>
<p>What is true of Stratford-upon-Avon is equally true of Abbotsford,
of the birth-place of Milton, Burns, Bunyan, Baxter, and other great
minds, which have shone each like a sun or star in its sphere.&nbsp;
Now, what one word, recognised as legitimate in scientific terminology,
would describe fully one of these disks of light cast by a human life
upon a certain space of earth, not as a fugitive flash, but as a permanent
illumination?&nbsp; <i>Photograph</i> would not do it, because its meaning
is fixed and rigidly technical, as simple light-writing, or sun-writing.&nbsp;
The term is completely pre-occupied by this signification, and you cannot
inject the human life element into it.&nbsp; <i>Biography</i> is universally
limited to an operation in which the life is the subject, not the agent.&nbsp;
It is simply the writing out of a life&rsquo;s history by some one with
a common goose-quill or steel pen.&nbsp; Still, the word <i>biograph</i>
would be the best, of the same length, that we could form to describe
one of these disks of light, if it were made the same verb active as
<i>photograph</i>; or to mean that the life is the agent, as well as
the subject,&mdash;that it writes itself in light upon a certain locality,
just as the sun graves a human face upon glass.&nbsp; Let us then call
the bright and quenchless planispheres, which such lives describe and
fill around them, <i>biographs</i>, assuming that the script is in rays
of light.&nbsp; As differ the stars above in glory, so these differ
in the qualities of their illumination.&nbsp; The brightest of them,
to mere human seeming, are those which shine with the sheer brilliancy
of intellect and genius.&nbsp; These chiefly halo the homes of &ldquo;the
grand old masters&rdquo; of poetry, painting, eloquence, and martial
glory.&nbsp; These attract to their disks pilgrims the most numerous
and enthusiastic.&nbsp; But, as the nearest stars are brightest, not
largest, so these biographs are brightest on their earth-side.&nbsp;
There are thousands of less sharp and spangling lustre to the eyes of
the multitude, which shine with tenfold more brilliancy from their eternity-face.&nbsp;
These are they that halo the homes of good men, whose great hearts drank
in the life of God&rsquo;s love in perpetual streams, and distilled
it like a luminous dew around them; men whose thoughts were not mere
scintillations of genius, but living labors of beneficence, bearing
the proof as well as promise of that immortality guaranteed to the deeds
of earth&rsquo;s saints.&nbsp; If the soul, after such long isolation,
is to take again to its embrace so much of the old human corporeity
it wore here below, does it transcend the prerogative of hope in the
great resurrection to believe that these biographs of God&rsquo;s loving
children on earth shall be taken up whole into the same immortality
as the bodies in which they worked His will among men?&nbsp; Is the
faith too fanciful or irreverent that believes, that the corridors and
inner temples of Heaven&rsquo;s Glory will be hung with these biographs
of His servants surrounding, like stars, the light-flood of His love
that radiated from His cross on earth?&nbsp; Is it too presumptuous
to think and say, that such pictures will be as precious in His sight
as any graven by the lives of angels on their outward or homeward flights
of duty and delight?&nbsp; These are they, therefore, that shall give
to the earth all the immortality to which it shall attain.&nbsp; These
are they that shall take up into the brilliant existence of the hereafter,
ten thousand sections of its corporeity; portions of its surface, perhaps,
as substantial as the human form that the souls of men shall wear in
another world.&nbsp; These are they that shall shine as the stars, when
those beaming so brilliantly in our eyes around the shrines of mere
intellect and genius, shall have &ldquo;paled their ineffectual fires&rdquo;
before the efflux of diviner light.&nbsp; Let him, then, of thoughtful
and attentive faculties think on these great and holy possibilities,
when he treads within the pale of a good man&rsquo;s life, whose labors
for human happiness &ldquo;follow him&rdquo; according to divine promise;
not out of the world, not down into the grave with his resting body,
but out among living generations, breathing upon them and through them
a blessed and everlasting influence.&nbsp; Let him tread that disk of
light reverentially, for it is the holiest place on the earth&rsquo;s
surface outside the immediate circumference of Cavalry.</p>
<p>This is Babraham; and here lived Jonas Webb; a good man and true,
whose influence and usefulness had a broader circumference than the
widest empire in the world.&nbsp; A Frenchman has written the fullest
history of both, and an American here offers reverentially a tribute
to his worth.&nbsp; The light of his life was a soft and gentle illumination
on its earth-side; the lustre of the other was revealed only by partial
glimpses to those who leaned closest to him in the testing-moments of
his higher nature.&nbsp; He was one of the great benefactors, whose
lives and labors become the common inheritance of mankind, and whose
names go down through long generations with a pleasant memory.&nbsp;
To a certain extent, he was to the great primeval industry of the world,
what Arkwright, Watts, Stephenson, Fulton and Morse were each to the
mechanical and scientific activities of the age.&nbsp; He did as much,
perhaps, as any man that ever preceded him, to honor that industry,
and lift it up to the level of the first occupations of modern times,
which had claimed higher qualities of intelligence, genius and enterprize.&nbsp;
He was a farmer, and his ancestors had been farmers from time immemorial.&nbsp;
He did not bound into the occupation as an enthusiastic amateur, who
had acquired a large fortune by manufacturing or commercial enterprize,
which he was eager to lavish upon bold and uncertain experiments.&nbsp;
He attained his highest eminence by the careful gradations of a continuous
experience, reaching back far into the labors of his ancestors.&nbsp;
The science, skill and judgment he brought to bear upon his operations,
came from his reading, thinking, observations and experiments as a practical
and hereditary farmer.&nbsp; The capital he employed in expanding these
operations to their culminating magnitude, he acquired by farming.&nbsp;
The mental culture, the generous dispositions, the refined manners,
the graceful and manly bearing which made him one of the first gentlemen
of the age, he acquired as a farmer.&nbsp; The mansion which welcomed
to its easy and large-hearted hospitalities guests of such distinction
from his own and other countries, was a farmer&rsquo;s home, and few
ever opened their doors to more urbanity and cordial cheer.&nbsp; This
is an aspect of his character which all those who follow the profession
he honored should admire with a laudable <i>esprit de corps</i>.</p>
<p>As a back-ground is an important element in the portraiture of human
forms or natural scenery, so the ground on which the life and labors
of Jonas Webb should be sketched, merits a few preliminary lines.&nbsp;
Of all the occupations that employ and sustain the toiling myriads of
our race, agriculture leans closest to the bosom of Divine Providence.&nbsp;
It is an industry bound to the great and beautiful economics of the
creation by more visible and sensible ties than any other worked by
human hands.&nbsp; We will not here diverge to dwell upon these high
and interesting affiliations.&nbsp; In their place we will give them
a little extended thought.&nbsp; There is one feature of agricultural
enterprize, however, that should not be overlooked in this connection.&nbsp;
All its operations are above-board and open to the wide world, just
like the fields to which they are applied.&nbsp; Nothing here is under
lock and key.&nbsp; Nothing bears the grim warning over the bolted door,
&ldquo;No admittance here except on business!&rdquo;&mdash;meaning by
business, exclusively and sharply, the buying of certain wares of the
establishment at a good round profit to the manufacturer, without carrying
away a single scintillation or suggestion of his skill.&nbsp; If he
has invented or adopted machinery or a process of labor which enables
him to turn out cheap muslin at three farthings&rsquo; less cost per
yard than his neighbors can make it, he seals up the secret from them
with the keenest vigilance.&nbsp; Not so in the great and heaven-honored
industry of agriculture.&nbsp; Its experiments and improvements upon
the earth&rsquo;s face are all put into the common stock of human knowledge
and happiness.&nbsp; They can no more be placed under lock and key,
as selfish secrets, than the stars themselves that look down upon them
with all their golden eyes.&nbsp; No new implement of husbandry, no
new mechanical force or chemical principle, no new process of labor
or line of economy is withheld from the great commonwealth of mankind.&nbsp;
As the broad skies above, as the sun and moon, and stars, as the winds,
the rains, the dews, the birds and bees of heaven over-ride and ignore,
in their missions, the boundaries of jealous nations, so all the great
activities of agriculture prove their lineage by following the same
generous rule.&nbsp; They are bounded by no nationalities.&nbsp; They
are shut up in no narrow enclosure of self, but are put out as new vesicles
of light to brighten the general illumination of the world.</p>
<p>The department in which Jonas Webb attained to his position and capacity
of usefulness was peculiarly marked by this characteristic.&nbsp; In
a certain sense, it occupied a higher range of interest than that section
of agriculture which is connected solely with the growing of grain,
grass, and other crops.&nbsp; His great and distinguishing husbandry
was the cultivation of animal life.&nbsp; To make two spires of grass
grow where only one grew before has been pronounced as a great benefaction;
and greater still are the merit and the gain of making one grow where
nothing grew before.&nbsp; To go into the midst of Dartmoor, and turn
an acre of its cold, stony, water-soaked waste into a fruitful field
of golden grain, is going into co-partnership with Providence in the
work of creation to a very large and honored degree.&nbsp; But to put
the skilful hand of science upon creatures of flesh and blood, to re-form
their physical structures and shapes, to add new inches to their stature,
straighten their backs, expand their reins, amplify their chests, reduce
all the lines and curves of their forms to an unborn symmetry, and then
to give silky softness and texture to their aboriginal clothing&mdash;this
seems to be mounting one step higher in the attainment and dignity of
creative faculties.&nbsp; And this pre-eminently was the department
in which Jonas Webb acquired a distinction perhaps unparalleled to the
present time.&nbsp; This has made his name familiar all over Christendom,
and honored among the world&rsquo;s benefactors.&nbsp; Never, before
him, did a farm-stead become such a centre and have such a wide-sweeping
radius as his.&nbsp; None ever possessed such centripetal attractions,
or exerted such centrifugal influences for the material well-being of
different and distant countries.&nbsp; Indeed, those most remote are
most specially indebted to his large and generous operations.&nbsp;
America and Australia will ever owe his memory an everlasting homage.</p>
<p>His operations filled and crowned two great departments of improvement
seldom, if ever, carried on simultaneously and evenly to a great success
by one man.&nbsp; His first distinguishing speciality was sheep-culture.&nbsp;
When he had brought this to the highest standard of perfection ever
attained, he devoted the surplus capital of skill, experience and pecuniary
means he had acquired from the process to the breeding of cattle; and
he became nearly as eminent in this field of improvement as in the other.&nbsp;
A few facts may serve as an outline of his progress in both to the American
reader who is familiar with the general result of his efforts.</p>
<p>Jonas Webb was born at Great Thurlow, Suffolk, on the 10th of November,
1796.&nbsp; His father, who died at the age of ninety-three, was a veteran
in agriculture, and had attained to honorable distinction by his efforts
to improve the old Norfolk breed of sheep, and by his experiments with
other races.&nbsp; The results obtained from these operations convinced
his son that more mutton and better wool could be made per acre from
the Southdown than from any other breed, upon nine-tenths of the arable
land of England, where the sheep are regularly folded, especially where
the land is poor.&nbsp; In 1822, he commenced that agricultural career
which won for him such a world-wide celebrity, by taking the Babraham
Farm, occupying about 1,000 acres, some twelve miles south of Cambridge.&nbsp;
In a very interesting letter, addressed to the <i>Farmers&rsquo; Magazine</i>,
about twenty years since, he gives a valuable <i>resume</i> of his experience
up to that time.&nbsp; In this he states several facts that may be especially
useful to American agriculturists.&nbsp; Having decided in his own mind
that the Southdowns were preferable to every other breed, for the two
properties mentioned, he went into Sussex, their native county, and
purchased the best rams and ewes that could be obtained of the principal
breeders, regardless of expense, and never made a cross from any other
breed afterwards.&nbsp; Nor was this all; he never introduced new blood
into his stock from flocks of the same breed, but, by a virtually in-and-in
process, he was able to produce qualities till then unknown to the race,
and to make them permanent and distinctive properties.&nbsp; Now this
achievement in itself has an interest beyond its utilitarian value to
the agricultural world.&nbsp; To</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Rejoice in the joy of well-created
things&rdquo;</p>
<p>is one of the best privileges and pleasures of a well-constituted
mind.&nbsp; But what higher honor can attach to human science or industry
than that of taking such a visible and effective part in that creation?&mdash;in
sending out into the world successive generations of animal life, bearing
each, through future ages and distant countries, the shaping impress
of human fingers, long since gone back to their dust; features, forms,
lines, curves, qualities and characteristics which those fingers, working,
as it were, on the right wrist of Divine Providence, gave to the sheep
and cattle upon a thousand hills in both hemispheres?&nbsp; There are
flocks and herds now grazing upon the boundless prairies of America,
the vast plains of Australia, the steppes of Russia, as well as on the
smaller and greener pastures of England, France, and Germany, that bear
these finger-marks of Jonas Webb, as mindless but everlasting memories
to his worth.&nbsp; If the owners of these &ldquo;well-created things&rdquo;
value the joy and profit which they thus derive from his long and laborious
years of devotion to their interests, let them see that these finger-prints
of his be not obliterated by their neglect, but be perpetuated for ever,
both for their own good and for an ever-living memorial to his name.</p>
<p>It is a fact of instructive suggestion, that although Mr. Webb commenced
his operations in 1822, he won his first prize for stock ewes at the
meeting of the Royal Agricultural Society at Cambridge in 1840.&nbsp;
Here he realised one of the serious disadvantages to which stock-breeders
in England are exposed, in &ldquo;showing&rdquo; sheep, cattle or swine
at these annual exhibitions.&nbsp; The great outside world, with tastes
that lean more to fat sirloins or shoulders than to the better symmetries
of animated nature, almost demands that every one of these unfortunate
beasts should be offered up as a bloated, blowing sacrifice to those
great twin idols of fleshy lust, Tallow and Lard.&nbsp; If, therefore,
a stock-raiser has not decided to drive his Shorthorn cow or Southdown
ewe immediately from the Fair-grounds to the butcher&rsquo;s shambles,
he runs an imminent risk of losing entirely the use and value of the
animal.&nbsp; So great is this risk, that much of the stock that would
be most useful for exhibition is withheld, and can only be seen by visiting
private establishments scattered over the kingdom.&nbsp; They are too
valuable to run the terrible gauntlet of oil-cake, bean and barley-meal,
through which they must flounder on in cruel obesity to the prize.&nbsp;
Especially is this the case with breeding animals.&nbsp; Mr. Webb&rsquo;s
experience at his first trial of the process, will illustrate its tendencies
and results.&nbsp; Of the nine shearling ewes he &ldquo;fed&rdquo; for
the Cambridge Show, he lost <i>four</i>, and only raised two or three
lambs from the rest.&nbsp; At the Exhibition of 1841, at Liverpool,
he won three out of four of the prizes offered by the Royal Agricultural
Society for Southdowns, or any other short-woolled sheep; two out of
four offered at Bristol, in 1842, and three out of four offered at Derby,
in 1843.&nbsp; But here again he over-fed two of his best sheep, under
the inexorable rule of fat, which exercises such despotic sway over
these annual competitions, and was obliged to kill them before the show.&nbsp;
It will suffice to show the loss he incurred by this costly homage to
Tallow, to give his own words on the subject:&mdash;&ldquo;I had refused
180 guineas for the hire of the two sheep for the season.&nbsp; I also
quite destroyed the usefulness of two other aged sheep by over-feeding
them last year.&nbsp; Neither of them propogated [sic] through the season,
and I have had each of them killed in consequence, which has so completely
tired me of overfeeding that I never intend exhibiting another aged
ram, unless I greatly alter my mind, or can find out some method of
feeding them which will not destroy the animals, and which I have hitherto
failed to accomplish.&rdquo;&nbsp; The conclusion which he adopted,
in view of these liabilities, may be useful to agriculturists in America
as well as in England.&nbsp; He says, &ldquo;What I intend exhibiting
in future will be shearlings only, as I believe they are not so easily
injured by extra feeding as aged sheep, partly by being more active,
and partly by having more time to put on their extra condition, by which
their constitutions are not likely to be so much impaired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At nearly every subsequent national exhibition, Mr. Webb carried
off the best prizes for Southdowns.&nbsp; At Dundee, in 1843, the Highland
Society paid him the compliment of having the likenesses of his sheep
taken for its museum in Edinburgh.&nbsp; He only received two checks
in these competitions after 1840, and these he rectified and overcame
in an interesting way.&nbsp; The first took place at the great meeting
at Exeter, in 1850, and the second at Chelmsford, in 1856.&nbsp; On
both of these occasions he was convinced that the judges had not done
justice to the qualities of his animals, and he resolved to submit their
judgment to a court of errors, or to the decision of a subsequent meeting
of the society.&nbsp; So, in 1851, he presented the unsuccessful candidate
at Exeter to the meeting at Windsor, and took the first prize for it.&nbsp;
This fully reversed the Exeter verdict.&nbsp; He resorted to the same
tribunal to set him right in regard to his apparent defeat at Chelmsford,
in 1856.&nbsp; Next year he presented the ram beaten there to the Salisbury
meeting, and another jury gave the animal the highest meed of merit.</p>
<p>It was at the zenith of his fame as a sheep-breeder that Mr. Webb
&ldquo;assisted,&rdquo; as the French say, at the Universal Exposition
at Paris, in 1855.&nbsp; Here his beautiful animals excited the liveliest
admiration.&nbsp; The Emperor came himself to examine them, and expressed
himself highly pleased at their splendid qualities.&nbsp; It was on
this occasion that Mr. Webb presented to the Emperor his prize ram,
for which, probably, he had refused the largest sum ever offered for
a single animal of the same race, or 500 guineas ($2,500).&nbsp; The
Emperor accepted the noble present, fully appreciating the spirit in
which it was offered, and some time afterwards sent the generous breeder
a magnificent candelabra, of solid silver, representing a grand, old
English oak, with a group of horses shading themselves under its branches.&nbsp;
This splendid token of the Emperor&rsquo;s regard is only one of the
numerous trophies and souvenirs that embellish the farmer&rsquo;s home
at Babraham, and which his children and remoter posterity will treasure
as precious heirlooms.</p>
<p>If Mr. Webb did not originate, he developed a system of usefulness
into a permanent and most valuable institution, which, perhaps, will
be the most novel to American stock-raisers.&nbsp; Having, by a long
course of scientific observations and experiments, <i>fixed</i> the
qualities he desired to give his Southdowns; having brought them to
the highest perfection, he now adopted a system which would most widely
and cheaply diffuse the race thus cultivated all over the civilized
world.&nbsp; He instituted an annual ram-letting, which took place in
the month of July.&nbsp; This occasion constituted an important event
to the great agricultural world.&nbsp; A few Americans have been present
and witnessed the proceedings of these memorable days, and they know
the interest attaching to them better than can be inferred from any
description.&nbsp; M. De La Trehonnais, in the &ldquo;Revue Agricole
de l&rsquo;Angleterre,&rdquo; thus sketches some of the incidents and
aspects of the occasion:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a proceeding regarded in England as a public event,
and all the journals give an account of it with exact care, assembling
from every county and even from foreign countries.&nbsp; The sale begins
about two o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; A circle in formed with ropes in a small
field near the mansion, where the rams are introduced, and an auctioneer
announces the biddings, which are frequently very spirited.&nbsp; The
rams to be let are exposed around the field from the first of the morning,
and a ticket at the head of each pen indicates the weight of the fleece
of the animal it contains.&nbsp; Every one takes his notes, chooses
the animal he approves of, and can demand the last bidding when he pleases.&nbsp;
The evening after the letting, the numerous company assembles under
a rustic shed, ornamented with leaves and agricultural devices.&nbsp;
There tables are laid, around which are placed two or three hundred
guests, and then commences one of those antique repasts described by
Homer or Rabelais.&nbsp; The tables groan under the enormous pieces
of beef, gigantic hams, etc., which have almost disappeared before the
commencement of the sale.&nbsp; From eight in the morning until two
in the afternoon, tables laid out in the dining-room and hall are furnished,
only to be refurnished immediately, the end being equal to the beginning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This description refers to the thirty-second letting.&nbsp; Mr. Webb&rsquo;s
flock then consisted of seven hundred breeding ewes, a proportionate
number of lambs, and about four hundred rams of different ages.&nbsp;
It was from these rams that the animals were selected which were sent
into every country in the civilized world.&nbsp; The average price of
their lettings was nearly &pound;24 each, although some of the rams
brought the sum of &pound;180, or nearly <i>nine hundred dollars</i>!&nbsp;
What would some of the old-fashioned farmers of New England, of forty
years ago, think of paying nearly a thousand dollars for the rent of
a ram for a single year, or even one-tenth of that sum?&nbsp; But this
rentage was not a fancy price.&nbsp; The farmer who paid it got back
his money many times over in the course of a few years.&nbsp; From this
infusion of the Babraham blood into his flock, he realised an augmented
production of mutton and wool annually per acre which he could count
definitely by pounds.&nbsp; The verdict of his balance-sheet proved
the profit of the investment.&nbsp; It would be impossible to measure
the benefit which the whole world reaped from Mr. Webb&rsquo;s labors
in this department of usefulness.&nbsp; An eminent authority has stated
that &ldquo;it would be difficult, if not impossible, to find a Southdown
flock of any reputation, in any country in the world, not closely allied
with the Babraham flock.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is a fact that illustrates
the skill and care, as well as demonstrates the value of his system
of improvement, that, after thirty-seven years as a breeder, the tribes
he founded maintained to the last those distinguishing qualities which
gave them such pre-eminence over all other sheep bearing the general
name of the Sussex race.&nbsp; So valuable and distinctive were these
qualities regarded by the best judges in the country, that the twelfth
ram-letting, which took place at the time of the Cambridge Show, brought
together 2,000 visitors, constituting, perhaps, the most distinguished
assembly of agriculturists ever convened.&nbsp; On this occasion the
Duke of Richmond, an hereditary and eminent breeder of Southdowns in
their native county, bid a hundred guineas for a ram lamb, which Mr.
Webb himself bought in.</p>
<p>Having attained to such eminence as a sheep-breeder, Mr. Webb entered
upon another sphere of improvement, in which he won almost equal distinction.&nbsp;
In 1837, he laid the foundation of the Babraham Herd of Shorthorn cattle,
made up of six different tribes, purchased from the most valuable and
celebrated branches of the race bearing that name.&nbsp; An incident
attaching to one of these purchases may illustrate the nice care and
cultivated skill which Mr. Webb exercised in the treatment of choice
animals.&nbsp; He bought out of Lord Spencer&rsquo;s herd the celebrated
cow, &ldquo;Dodona.&rdquo;&nbsp; That eminent breeder, it appears, had
given her up as irretrievably sterile, and he parted with her solely
on that account.&nbsp; Mr. Webb, however, took her to Babraham, and,
as a result of the more intelligent treatment he bestowed upon her,
she produced successively four calves, which thus formed one of the
most valuable families of the Babraham herd.&nbsp; When I visited the
scene of his life and labors, all his sheep and cattle had been sold.&nbsp;
But two or three animals bought by an Australian gentleman were still
in the keeping of Mr. Webb&rsquo;s son, awaiting arrangements for their
transportation.&nbsp; One of these, a beautiful heifer of fourteen months,
was purchased at the winding-up sale, for 225 guineas.&nbsp; It was
called the &ldquo;Drawing-room Rose,&rdquo; from this circumstance,
as I afterwards learned.&nbsp; When it was first dropped by the dam,
Mr. Webb was confined to the house by indisposition.&nbsp; But he had
such a desire to see this new accession to his bovine family, that he
directed it to be brought into the drawing-room for that purpose.&nbsp;
Hence it received a more elegant and domestic appellation than the variegated
nomenclature of high-blooded animals often allows.</p>
<p>When the last volume of the &ldquo;English Herd-Book&rdquo; was about
to be published, Mr. Webb sent for insertion a list of sixty-one cows,
with their products.&nbsp; He generally kept from twenty to thirty bulls
in his stalls.</p>
<p>Nor were his labors confined even to the two great spheres of enterprise
with which his name has been intimately and honorably associated.&nbsp;
If it was the great aim of his intelligent activities to produce stock
which should yield the most meat to the acre, he also gave great attention
to the augmented production of the land itself.&nbsp; He was the principal
originator and promoter of the great Agricultural Hall, in London, for
the exhibition of the fat stock for the Smithfield Show.&nbsp; This
may be called the Crystal Palace of the animal world.&nbsp; It is the
grandest structure ever erected for the exhibition of cattle, sheep,
swine, poultry, etc.&nbsp; I will essay no description of it here, but
it will carry through long generations the name and memory of Jonas
Webb of Babraham.&nbsp; He was chairman of the company that built the
superb edifice; also president of the Nitro-phosphate or Blood-manure
Company, a fertilizer in which he had the greatest confidence, and which
he used in great quantities upon the large farm he cultivated, containing
over 2,000 acres.</p>
<p>At the age of nearly sixty-six, Mr. Webb found that his health would
no longer stand the strain of the toil, care, and anxiety requisite
to keep up the Babraham flock to the high standard of perfection which
it had attained.&nbsp; So, after nearly forty years of devotion to this
great occupation of his life, he concluded to retire from it altogether,
dispersing his sheep and cattle as widely as purchasers might be found.&nbsp;
This breaking-up took place at Babraham on the 10th of July, 1862.&nbsp;
Then and there the long series of annual re-unions terminated for ever.&nbsp;
The occasion had a mournful interest to many who had attended those
meetings from year to year.&nbsp; It seemed like the voluntary and unexpected
abdication of an Alexander, still able to add to his conquests and trophies.&nbsp;
All present felt this; and several tried to express it at the old table
now spread for the last time for such guests.&nbsp; But his inherent
and invincible modesty waived aside or intercepted the compliments that
came from so many lips.&nbsp; With a kind of ingenious delicacy, which
one of the finest of human sentiments could only inspire, he contrived
to divert attention or reference to himself and his life&rsquo;s labors.&nbsp;
But he could not make the company forget them, even if he gently checked
allusion to them.</p>
<p>The company on this interesting occasion was very large, about 1,000
persons having sat down to the collation.&nbsp; Not only were the principal
nobility and gentry of Great Britain interested in agricultural pursuits
present in large number, but the representatives of nearly every other
country in Christendom.&nbsp; Several gentlemen from the United States
were among the purchasers.&nbsp; The total number of sheep sold was
969, which fetched under the hammer the great aggregate of &pound;10,926,
or more than $54,000.&nbsp; The most splendid ram in the flock went
to the United States, being knocked down to Mr. J. C. Taylor, of Holmdale,
New Jersey; who is doing so much to Americanise the Southdowns.&nbsp;
Others went to the Canadas, Australia, South America, and to nearly
every country in continental Europe.</p>
<p>Thus was formed, and thus was dispersed the famous Babraham flock.&nbsp;
And such were the labors of Jonas Webb for the material well-being of
mankind.&nbsp; These alone, detached from those qualities and characteristics
which make up and reflect a higher nature, entitle his name to a wide
and lasting memory among men.&nbsp; And these labors and successes are
they that those who have read of them in different countries know him
by.&nbsp; These comprise and present the character they honor with respect.&nbsp;
What he was in the temper and disposition of his inner life, in daily
walk and conversation, in the even and gentle amenities of Christian
humility, in sudden trials of his faith and patience; what he was as
a husband, father, friend and neighbor, to the poor, to the afflicted
in mind, body or estate,&mdash;all this will remain unwritten, but not
unremembered by those who breathed and moved within that disk of light
which his life shed around him.</p>
<p>Few men have lived in whom so many personal and moral qualities combined
to command respect, esteem, and even admiration.&nbsp; In stature, countenance,
expression, and deportment, he was a noble specimen of fully developed
English manhood.&nbsp; To this first, external aspect, his kindly and
generous dispositions, his genial manners, his delicate but dignified
modesty, his large intelligence and large-heartedness, gave the additional
and crowning characteristic of a Christian gentleman.&nbsp; Many Americans
have visited Babraham, and enjoyed the hospitalities which such a host
could only give and grace.&nbsp; They will remember the paintings hung
around the walls of that drawing-room, in which his commanding form,
in the strength and beauty of meridian life, towers up in the rural
landscape, surrounded by cattle and sheep bearing the impress of his
skill and care.&nbsp; A little incident occurred a few years ago, which
may illustrate this personal aspect better than any simile of description.&nbsp;
On the occasion of one of the great Agricultural Expositions in Paris,
a deputation or a company of gentlemen went over to represent the Agricultural
Society of England.&nbsp; Mr. Webb was one of the number; and some French
nobleman who had known him personally, as well as by reputation, was
very desirous of making him a guest while in Paris.&nbsp; To be sure
of this pleasure, he sent a special courier all the way to Folkestone,
charged with a letter which he was himself to put into the hands of
Mr. Webb, before the steamer left the dock.&nbsp; &ldquo;But how am
I to know the gentleman?&rdquo; asked the courier; &ldquo;I never saw
him in my life.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>N&rsquo;importe</i>,&rdquo; was
the reply.&nbsp; &ldquo;Put the letter in the hand of the noblest-looking
man on board, and you will be sure to be right.&rdquo;&nbsp; The courier
followed the direction; and, stationing himself near the gangway, he
took his master&rsquo;s measure of every passenger as he entered.&nbsp;
He could not be mistaken.&nbsp; As soon as the plank was withdrawn,
he approached Mr. Webb, hat in hand, and, with a deferential word of
recognition, done in the best grace of French politeness, handed him
the letter.&nbsp; One of the deputation, noticing the incident, and
wondering how the man knew whom he was addressing without previous inquiry,
questioned him afterwards on the subject, and learned from him the ground
on which he proceeded.&nbsp; The photographic likeness presented in
connection with this notice was taken shortly before his decease, at
the age of nearly sixty-six, and when his health was greatly impaired.</p>
<p>Few men ever carried out so fully the injunction, not to let the
left hand know what the right hand did, in the quiet and steady outflow
of good will and good works, as Mr. Webb.&nbsp; Even those nearest and
dearest to him never knew what that right hand did as a help in time
of need, what that large heart felt in time of others&rsquo; affliction,
what those lips said to the sorrowing, in tearful moments of grief,
until they had been stilled for ever on earth.&nbsp; Then it came out,
act by act, word by word, thought by thought, from those who held the
remembrances in their souls as precious souvenirs of a good man&rsquo;s
life.&nbsp; So earnest was his desire to do these things in secret,
that his own family heard of them only by accident, and from those whom
he so greatly helped with his kindness and generosity.&nbsp; And when
known by his wife and children, in this way, they were put under the
bann of secrecy.&nbsp; This it is that makes it so difficult to delineate
the home and heaven side of his character.&nbsp; Those nearest to him,
who breathed in the blessing of its daily odor, so revere his repeated
and earnest wish not to have his good works talked of in public, that,
even now he is dead and gone, they hold it as a sacred obligation to
his memory not to give up these treasured secrets of his life.&nbsp;
Thus, in giving a partial <i>coup d&rsquo;&oelig;il</i> of that aspect
of his character which fronted homeward and heavenward, one can only
glean, here and there, glimpses of different traits, in acts, incidents,
and anecdotes remembered by neighbors and friends near and remote.&nbsp;
Were it not that his children are withheld, by this delicate veneration,
from giving to the public facts known to them alone, the moral beauty
and brightness of his life would shine out upon the outside world with
warmer rays and larger <i>rayons</i>.&nbsp; I hope that a single passage
from a letter written by one of them to a friend, even under the injunction
of confidence, may be given here, without rending the veil which they
hold so sacred.&nbsp; In referring to this disposition and habit of
her venerated father, she says&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Often have I been so blessed as to be caused to shed tears
of joy and pride at hearing proofs of his tenderness, kindness, and
generosity related by the recipients of some token of his nobleness,
but of which we never should have heard from himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A little incident may illustrate this trait of his disposition.&nbsp;
In 1862, a &ldquo;Loan Court&rdquo; was held in London, at which there
was a most magnificent display of jewels and plate of all kinds, contributed
by their owners to be exhibited for the gratification of the public.&nbsp;
A friend, who held him in the highest veneration, returning from this
brilliant show, expressed regret that Mr. Webb had not furnished one
of the stands, by sending the splendid silver candelabra presented to
him by the French Emperor, with the many silver cups and medals he had
won.&nbsp; Mr. Webb replied, that the mercies God had blessed him with,
and the successes He had awarded to him, might have been sent to teach
him humility, and not given to parade before the world.</p>
<p>It is one of the most striking proofs of his great and pure-heartedness,
that, notwithstanding nearly forty consecutive years of vigorous and
successful competition with the leading agriculturists of Great Britain
and other countries, none of the victories he won over them, or the
eminence he attained, ever made him an enemy.&nbsp; When we consider
the eager ambitions and excited sensibilities that enter into these
competitions, this fact in itself shows what manner of man he was in
his disposition and deportment.&nbsp; Referring to this aspect of his
character, the French writer already cited, M. De La Trehonnais, says
of him, while still living&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There exists no person who has gained the esteem and goodwill
of his contemporaries to a higher degree than Mr. Webb.&nbsp; His probity,
his scrupulous good faith, his generosity, and the affable equality
of his character, have gained for him the respect and affection of every
one.&nbsp; Since I have had the honor of knowing him, which is already
many years, I have never known of his having a single enemy; and in
my constant intercourse with the agricultural classes of England, I
have never heard of a single malevolent insinuation respecting him.&nbsp;
When we consider how much those who raise themselves in the world above
others, are made the butt for the attacks of envy in proportion with
their elevation, we may conclude that there are in the character of
this wealthy man very solid virtues, well fixed principles, transcendant
[sic] merit, to have passed through his long career of success and triumphs
without having drawn upon himself the ill-will of a single enemy, or
the calumnious shaft of envy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nor were these negative virtues, ending where they begun, or enabling
him to go through a long life of energetic activities without an enemy.&nbsp;
He not only lived at peace with all men, but did his utmost to make
them live at peace with each other.&nbsp; Says one who knew him intimately&mdash;&ldquo;I
never heard him express a sentiment savoring of enmity to any person,
nor could he bear to see it entertained by any one towards another.&nbsp;
Even if he heard of an ill-feeling existing between persons, he would,
if possible, effect a reconciliation; and his own bright example, and
hearty, kind, genial manners always warmed all hearts towards himself.&nbsp;
Notwithstanding the numerous calls upon his time, made by public and
private business, he did not lose his sweet cheerfulness of temper,
and was ever ready in his most busy moments to aid others, if he saw
a possibility of so doing.&rdquo;&nbsp; Energy, gentleness, conscientiousness
and courtesy were seldom, if ever, blended in such suave accord as in
him.&nbsp; These virtues came out, each in its distinctive lustre, under
the trials and vexations which try human nature most severely.&nbsp;
All who knew him marvelled that he was able to maintain such sweetness
and evenness of temper under provocations and difficulties which would
have greatly annoyed most men.&nbsp; What he was in these outer circles
of his influence, he was, to all the centralization of his virtues,
in the heart of his family.&nbsp; Here, indeed, the best graces of his
character had their full play and beauty.&nbsp; He was the centre and
soul of one of the happiest of earthly homes, attracting to him the
affections of every member of the hearth circle that moved in the sleepless
light of his life.&nbsp; Here he did not rule, but led by love.&nbsp;
It alone dictated, and it alone obeyed.&nbsp; It inspired its like in
domestic discipline.&nbsp; Spontaneous reverence for such a father&rsquo;s
wish and will superseded the unpleasant necessity of more active parental
constraint.&nbsp; To bring a shade of sadness to that venerated face,
or a speechless reproach to that benignant eye, was a greater punishment
to a temporarily wayward child than any corporal correction could have
inflicted.</p>
<p>No one of the hundreds that were present at the sale and dispersion
of the Babraham flock could have thought that the remaining days of
the great and good man were to be so few on earth.&nbsp; He was then
about sixty-five years of age, of stately, unbending form and face radiant
and genial with the florid flush of that Indian Summer which so many
Englishmen wear late in those autumnal years that bend and pale American
forms and faces to &ldquo;the sere and yellow leaf&rdquo; of life.&nbsp;
But the sequel proved that he did not abdicate his position too early.&nbsp;
In a little more than a year from this event, his spirit was raised
to higher fellowships and folded with those of the pure and blest of
bygone ages.&nbsp; The incidents and coincidents of the last, great
moments of his being here, were remarkable and affecting.&nbsp; Neither
he nor his wife died at the home they had made so happy with the beauty
and savor of their virtues.&nbsp; Under another and distant roof they
both laid themselves down to die.&nbsp; The husband&rsquo;s hand was
linked in his wife&rsquo;s, up to within a few short steps of the river&rsquo;s
brink, when, touched with the cold spray of the dark waters, it fell
from its hold and was superseded by the strong arm of the angel of the
covenant, sent to bear her fast across the flood.&nbsp; In life they
were united to a oneness seldom witnessed on earth; in death they were
not separated except by the thinnest partition.&nbsp; Though her spirit
was taken up first to the great and holy communion above, the &ldquo;ministering
angel of God&rsquo;s love let her body remain with him as a pledge until
his own spirit was called to join hers in the joint mansion of their
eternal rest.&nbsp; On the very day that her body was carried to its
long home, his own unloosed, to its upward flight, the soul that had
made it shine for half a century like a temple erected to the Divine
Glory.&nbsp; The years allotted to him on earth were even to a day.&nbsp;
Just sixty-six were measured off to him, and then &ldquo;the wheel ceased
to turn at the cistern,&rdquo; and he died on his birthday.&nbsp; An
affecting coincidence also marked the departure of his beloved wife.&nbsp;
She left on the birthday of her eldest son, who had intended to make
the anniversary the dating-day of domestic happiness, by choosing it
for his marriage.</p>
<p>A few facts will suffice for the history of the closing scene.&nbsp;
About the middle of October, 1862, Mrs. Webb, whose health seemed failing,
went to visit her brother, Henry Marshall, Esq., residing in Cambridge.&nbsp;
Here she suddenly became much worse, and the prospect of her recovery
more and more doubtful.&nbsp; Mr. Webb was with her immediately on the
first unfavorable turn of her illness, together with other members of
the family.&nbsp; When he realised her danger, and the hope of her surviving
broke down within him, his physical constitution succumbed under the
impending blow, and two days before her death, he was prostrated by
a nervous fever, from which he never rallied, but died on the 10th of
November.&nbsp; Although the great visitation was too heavy for his
flesh and blood to bear, his spirit was strengthened to drink this last
cup of earthly trial with beautiful serenity and submission.&nbsp; It
was strong enough to make his quivering lips to say, in distinct and
audible utterance, and his closing eyes to pledge the truth and depth
of the sentiment, &ldquo;Thy will be done!&rdquo;&nbsp; One who stood
over him in these last moments says, that, when assured of his own danger,
his countenance only seemed to take on a light of greater happiness.&nbsp;
He was conscious up to within a few minutes of his death, and, though
unable to speak articulately, responded by expressions of his countenance
to the words and looks of affection addressed to him by the dear ones
surrounding his bed.&nbsp; One of them read to him a favorite hymn,
beginning with &ldquo;Cling to the Comforter!&rdquo;&nbsp; When she
ceased, he signed to her to repeat it; and, while the words were still
on her lips, the Comforter came at his call, and bore his waiting spirit
away to the heavenly companionship for which it longed.&nbsp; As it
left the stilled temple of its earthly habitation, it shed upon the
delicately-carved lines of its marble door and closed windows a sweet
gleam of the morning twilight of its own happy immortality.</p>
<p>A long funeral cortege attended the remains of the deceased from
Cambridge to their last resting place in the little village churchyard
of Babraham.&nbsp; Beside friends from neighboring villages, the First
Cambridgeshire Mounted Rifle Corps joined the procession, together with
a large number of the county police force.&nbsp; His body was laid down
to its last, long rest beside that of his wife, who preceded him to
the tomb only by a few days.&nbsp; Though Stratford-upon-Avon, and Dryburgh
Abbey may attract more American travellers to their shrines, I am sure
many of them, with due perception of moral worth, will visit Babraham,
and hold it in reverent estimation as the home of one of the world&rsquo;s
best worthies, who left on it a biograph which shall have a place among
the human-life-scapes which the Saviour of mankind shall hang up in
the inner temple of His Father&rsquo;s glory, as the most precious tokens
and trophies of the earth, on which He shared the tearful experiences
of humanity, and bore back to His throne all the touching memories of
its weaknesses, griefs, and sorrows.</p>
<p>A movement is now on foot to erect a suitable monument to his memory.&nbsp;
It may indicate the public estimation in which his life and labors are
held that, already, about &pound;10,000 have been subscribed towards
this testimonial to his worth.&nbsp; The monument, doubtless, will be
placed in the great Agricultural Hall, which he did so much to found.&nbsp;
His name will wear down to coming generations the crystal roofage of
that magnificent edifice as a fitting crown of honor.</p>

<p><i>THRESHING MACHINE&mdash;FLOWER SHOW&mdash;THE HOLLYHOCK AND ITS
SUGGESTIONS&mdash;THE LAW OF CO-OPERATIVE ACTIVITIES IN VEGETABLE, ANIMAL,
MENTAL, AND MORAL LIFE.</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;In all places, then, and in
all seasons,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flowers expand
their light and soul-like wings,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teaching
us, by most persuasive reasons,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How
akin they are to human things.&rdquo;&mdash;LONGFELLOW.</p>
<p>My stay at Babraham was short.&nbsp; It was like a visit to the grave
of one of those English worthies whose lives and labors are so well
known and appreciated in America.&nbsp; All the external features of
the establishment were there unchanged.&nbsp; The large and substantial
mansion, with its hall and parlor walls hung with the mementoes of the
genius and success that had made it so celebrated; the barns and housings
for the great herds and flocks which had been dispersed over the world;
the very pens still standing in which they had been folded in for the
auctioneer&rsquo;s hammer; all these arrangements and aspects remained
as they were when Jonas Webb left his home to return no more.&nbsp;
But all those beautiful and happy families of animal life, which he
reared to such perfection, were scattered on the wings of wind and steam
to the uttermost and most opposite parts of the earth.</p>
<p>The eldest son, Mr. Samuel Webb, who supervises part of the farm
occupied by his father, and also carries on one of his own in a neighboring
parish, was very cordial and courteous, and drove me to his establishment
near Chesterford.&nbsp; Here a steam threshing machine was at work,
doing prodigious execution on different kinds of grain.&nbsp; The engine
had climbed, <i>a proprii motu</i>, a long ascent; had made its way
partly through ploughed land to the rear of the barn, and was rattlingly
busy in a fog of dust, doing the labor of a hundred flails.&nbsp; Ricks
of wheat and beans, each as large as a comfortable cottage, disappeared
in quick succession through the fingers of the chattering, iron-ribbed
giant, and came out in thick and rapid streams of yellow grain.&nbsp;
Swine seemed to be the speciality to which this son of Mr. Webb is giving
some of that attention which his father gave to sheep.&nbsp; There were
between 200 and 300 in the barn-yards and pens, of different ages and
breeds, all looking in excellent condition.</p>
<p>From Chesterford I went on to Cambridge, where I remained for the
most part of two days, on account of a heavy fall of rain, which kept
me within doors nearly all the time.&nbsp; I went out, however, for
an hour or so to see a Flower Show in the Town Hall.&nbsp; The varieties
and specimens made a beautiful, but not very extensive array.&nbsp;
There was one flower that not only attracted especial admiration, but
invited a pleasant train of thoughts to my own mind.&nbsp; It was one
of those old favorites to which the common people of all countries,
who speak our mother tongue, love to give an inalienable English name&mdash;<i>The
Hollyhock</i>.&nbsp; It is one of the flowers of the people, which the
pedantic Latinists have left untouched in homely Saxon, because the
people would have none of their long-winded and heartless appellations.&nbsp;
Having dwelt briefly upon the honor that Divine Providence confers upon
human genius and labor, in letting them impress their finger-marks so
distinctly upon the features and functions of the earth, and upon the
forms of animal life, it may be a profitable recurrence to the same
line of thought to notice what that same genius and labor have wrought
upon the structure and face of this familiar flower.&nbsp; What was
it at first?&nbsp; What is it now in the rural gardens of New England?&nbsp;
A shallow, bell-mouthed cup, in most cases purely white, and hung to
a tall, coarse stalk, like the yellow jets of a mullein.&nbsp; That
is its natural and distinctive characteristic in all countries; at least
where it is best known and most common.&nbsp; What is it here, bearing
the fingerprints of man&rsquo;s mind and taste upon it?&nbsp; Its white
and thin-sided cup is brim full and running over with flowery exuberance
of leaf and tint infinitely variegated.&nbsp; Here it is as solid, as
globe-faced, and nearly as large as the dahlia.&nbsp; Place it side
by side with the old, single-leafed hollyhock, in a New England farmer&rsquo;s
garden, and his wife would not be able to trace any family relationship
between them, even through the spectacles with which she reads the Bible.&nbsp;
But the dahlia itself&mdash;what was that in its first estate, in the
country in which it was first found in its aboriginal structure and
complexion?&nbsp; As plain and unpretending as the hollyhock; as thinly
dressed as the short-kirtled daisy in a Connecticut meadow.&nbsp; It
is wonderful, and passing wonder, how teachable and quick of perception
and prehension is Nature in the studio of Art.&nbsp; She, the oldest
of painters, that hung the earth, sea, and sky of the antediluvian world
with landscapes, waterscapes, and cloudscapes manifold and beautiful,
when as yet the human hand had never lifted a pencil to imitate her
skill; she, with the colors wherewith she dyed the fleecy clouds that
spread their purple drapery over the first sunset, and in which she
dipped the first rainbow hung in heaven, and the first rose that breathed
and blushed on earth; she that has embellished every day, since the
Sun first opened its eye upon the world, with a new gallery of paintings
for every square mile of land and sea, and new dissolving views for
every hour&mdash;she, with all these artistic antecedents, tastes, and
faculties, comes modestly into the conservatory of the floriculturist,
and takes lessons of him in shaping and tinting plants and flowers which
the Great Master said were &ldquo;all very good&rdquo; on the sixth-day
morning of the creation!&nbsp; This is marvellous, showing a prerogative
in human genius almost divine, and worthy of reverent and grateful admiration.&nbsp;
How wide-reaching and multigerent is this prerogative!&nbsp; In how
many spheres of action it works simultaneously in these latter days!&nbsp;
See how it manipulates the brute forces of Nature!&nbsp; See how it
saddles the winds, and bridles and spurs the lightning!&nbsp; See how
it harnesses steam to the plough, the flood to the spindle, the quick
cross currents of electricity to the newsman&rsquo;s phaeton!&nbsp;
Then ascend to higher reaches of its faculty.&nbsp; In the hands of
a Bakewell or Webb, it gives a new and creative shaping to multitudinous
generations of animal life.&nbsp; Nature yields to its suggestion and
leading, and co-works, with all her best and busiest activities, to
realise the human ideal; to put muscle there, to straighten that vertebra,
to parallel more perfectly those dorsal and ventral lines, to lengthen
or shorten those bones; to flesh the leg only to such a joint, and wool
or unwool it below; to horn or unhorn the head, to blacken or blanch
the face, to put on the whole body a new dress and make it and its remote
posterity wear this new form and costume for evermore.&nbsp; All this
shows how kindly and how proudly Nature takes Art into partnership with
her, in these new structures of beauty and perfection; both teaching
and taught, and wooing man to work with her, and walk with her, and
talk with her within the domain of creative energies; to make the cattle
and sheep of ten thousand hills and valleys thank the Lord, out of the
grateful speech of their large, lustrous eyes, for better forms and
features, and faculties of comfort than their early predecessors were
born to.</p>
<p>Equally wonderful, perhaps more beautiful, is the joint work of Nature
and Art on the sweet life and glory of flowers.&nbsp; However many they
were, and what they were, that breathed upon the first Spring or Summer
day of time, each was a half-sealed gift of God to man, to be opened
by his hand when his mind should open to a new sense of beauty and perfection.&nbsp;
Flowers, each with a genealogy reaching unbroken through the Flood back
to the overhanging blossoms of Eden, have come down to us, as it were,
only in their travelling costume, with their best dresses packed away
in stamen, or petal, or private seedcase, to be brought out at the end
of fifty centuries at the touch of human genius.&nbsp; Those of which
Solomon sang in his time, and which exceeded his glory in their every-day
array, even &ldquo;the hyssop by the wall,&rdquo; never showed, on the
gala-days of his Egyptian bride, the hidden charms which he, in his
wisdom, knew not how to unlock.&nbsp; Flowers innumerable are now, like
illuminated capitals of Nature&rsquo;s alphabet, flecking, with their
sheen-dots, prairie, steppe, mountain and meadow, the earth around,
which, perhaps, will only give their best beauties to the world in a
distant age.&nbsp; As the light of the latest-created and remotest stars
has not yet completed its downward journey to the eye of man, so to
his sight have not these sweet-breathing constellations of the field
yet made the full revelation of their treasured hues and forms.&nbsp;
Not one in a hundred of them all has done this up to the present moment.&nbsp;
When one in ten of those that bless us with their life and being shall
put on all its reserved beauty, then, indeed, the stars above and the
stars below will stud the firmaments in which they shine with equal
glory, and blend both in one great heaven-scape for the eye and heart
of man.&nbsp; One by one, in its turn, the key of human genius shall
unlock the hidden wardrobe of the commonest flowers, and deck them out
in the court dress reserved, for five thousand years, to be worn in
the brighter, afternoon centuries of the world.&nbsp; The Mistress of
the Robes is a high dignitary in the Household of Royalty, and has her
place near to the person of the Queen.&nbsp; But the Floriculturist,
of educated perception and taste, is the master of a higher state robe,
and holds the key of embroidered vestments, cosmetics, tintings, artistries,
hair-jewels, head-dresses, brooches, and bracelets, which no empress
ever wore since human crowns were made; which Nature herself could not
show on all the bygone birthdays of her being.</p>
<p>This is marvellous.&nbsp; It is an honor to man, put upon him from
above, as one of the gratuitous dignities of his being.&nbsp; &ldquo;An
undevout astronomer is mad,&rdquo; said one who had opened his mind
to a broad grasp of the wonders which this upper heaven holds in its
bosom.&nbsp; The floriculturist is an astronomer, with Newton&rsquo;s
telescope reversed; and if its revelations do not stir up holy thoughts
in his soul, he is blind as well as mad.&nbsp; No glass, no geometry
that Newton ever lifted at the still star-worlds above, could do more
than <i>reveal</i>.&nbsp; At the farthest stretch of their faculty,
they could only bring to light the life and immortality of those orbs
which the human eye had never seen before.&nbsp; They could not tint
nor add a ray to one of them all.&nbsp; They never could bring down
to the reach of man&rsquo;s unaided vision a single star that Noah could
not see through the deck-lights of the ark.&nbsp; It was a gift and
a glory that well rewarded the science and genius of Newton and Herschel,
of Adams and Le Verrier, that they could ladder these mighty perpendicular
distances and climb the rounds to such heights and sweeps of observation,
and count, measure, and name orbs and orbits before unknown, and chart
the paths of their rotations and weigh them, as in scales, while in
motion.&nbsp; But this <i>ge</i>-astronomer, whose observatory is his
conservatory, whose telescope and fluxions are his trowel and watering-pot,
not only brings to light the hidden life of a thousand earth-stars,
but changes their forms, colors their rays, half creates and transforms,
until each differs as much from its original structure and tinting as
the planet Jupiter would differ from its familiar countenance if Adams
or Le Verrier could make it wear the florid face of Mars.&nbsp; This
man,&mdash;and it is to be hoped he carries some devout and grateful
thoughts to his work&mdash;sets Nature new lessons daily in artistry,
and she works out the new ideals of his taste to their joint and equal
admiration.&nbsp; He has got up a new pattern for the fern.&nbsp; She
lets him guide her hand in the delicate operation, and she crimps, fringes,
shades or shapes its leaflets to his will, even to a thousand varieties.&nbsp;
He moistens her fingers with the fluids she uses on her easel, and puts
them to the rootlets of the rose, and they transpose its hues, or fringe
it or tinge it with a new glory.&nbsp; He goes into the fen or forest,
or climbs the jutting crags of lava-mailed mountains, and brings back
to his fold one of Nature&rsquo;s foundlings,&mdash;a little, pale-faced
orphan, crouching, pinched and starved, in a ragged hood of dirty muslin;
and he puts it under the fostering of those maternal fingers, guided
by his own.&nbsp; Soon it feels the inspiration of a new life warming
and swelling its shrivelled veins.&nbsp; Its paralysed petals unfold,
one by one.&nbsp; The rim of its cup fills, leaf by leaf, to the brim.&nbsp;
It becomes a thing most lovely and fair, and he introduces it, with
pride, to the court beauties of his crystal palace.</p>
<p>The agriculturist is taken into this co-partnership of Nature in
a higher domain of her activities, measured by the great utilities of
human life.&nbsp; We have glanced at the joint-work in her animal kingdom.&nbsp;
In the vegetable, it is equally wonderful.&nbsp; Nature contributes
the raw material of these great and vital industries, then incites and
works out human suggestions.&nbsp; Thus she trains and obeys the mind
and hand of man, in this grand sphere of development.&nbsp; Their co-working
and its result are just as perceptible in a common Irish potato as in
the most gorgeous dahlia ever exhibited.&nbsp; Not one farmer in a thousand
has ever read the history of that root of roots, in value to mankind;
has ever conceived what a tasteless, contracted, water-soaked thing
it was in its wild and original condition.&nbsp; Let them read a few
chapters of the early history of New England, and they will see what
it was two hundred and fifty years ago, when the strong-hearted men
and women, whom Hooker led to the banks of the Connecticut, sought for
it in the white woods of winter, scraping away the snow with their frosted
fingers.&nbsp; The largest they found just equalled the Malaga grape
in size and resembled it in complexion.&nbsp; They called it the <i>ground-nut</i>,
for it seemed akin to the nuts dropped by the oaks of different names.&nbsp;
No flower that breathes on earth has been made to produce so many varieties
of form, complexion, and name as this homely root.&nbsp; It would be
an interesting and instructive enterprise, to array all the varieties
of this queen of esculent vegetables which Europe and America could
exhibit, face to face with all the varieties which the dahlia, geranium,
pansy, or even the fern has produced, and then see which has been numerically
the most prolific in diversification of forms and features.&nbsp; It
should gratify a better motive than curiosity to trace back the history
of other roots to their aboriginal condition.&nbsp; Types of the original
stock may now be found, in waste places, in the wild turnip, wild carrot,
parsnip, etc.&nbsp; &ldquo;Line upon line, precept upon precept, here
a little and there a little,&rdquo; it may be truly and gratefully said,
these roots, internetted with the very life-fibres of human sustenance,
have been brought to their present perfection and value.&nbsp; The great
governments and peoples of the world should give admiring and grateful
thought to this fact.&nbsp; Here nature co-works with the most common
and inartistic of human industries, as they are generally held, with
faculties as subtle and beautiful as those which she brings to bear
upon the choicest flowers.&nbsp; The same is true of grains and grasses
for man and beast.&nbsp; They come down to us from a kind of heathen
parentage, receiving new forms and qualities from age to age.&nbsp;
The wheats, which make the bread of all the continents, now exhibit
varieties which no one has undertaken to enumerate.&nbsp; Fruits follow
the same rule, and show the same joint-working of Nature and Art as
in the realm of flowers.</p>
<p>The wheel within wheel, the circle within circle expand and ascend
until the last circumferential line sweeps around all the world of created
being, even taking in, upon the common radius, the highest and oldest
of the angels.&nbsp; From the primrose peering from the hedge to the
premier seraph wearing the coronet of his sublime companionship; from
the lowest forms of vegetable existence to the loftiest reaches of moral
nature this side of the Infinite, this everlasting law of co-working
rules the ratio of progress and development.&nbsp; In all the concentric
spheres strung on the radius measured by these extremes, there is the
same co-acting of internal and external forces.&nbsp; And mind, of man
or angel, guides and governs both.&nbsp; Not a flower that ever breathed
on earth, not one that ever blushed in Eden, could open all its hidden
treasures of beauty without the co-working of man&rsquo;s mind and taste.&nbsp;
No animal that ever bowed its neck to his yoke, or gave him labor, milk
or wool, could come to the full development of its latent vitalities
and symmetries without the help of his thought and skill.&nbsp; The
same law obtains in his own physical nature.&nbsp; Mind has made it
what it is to-day, as compared with the wild features and habits of
its aboriginal condition.&nbsp; Mind has worked for five thousand years
upon its fellow-traveller through time, to fit it more and more fully
for the companionship.&nbsp; It was delivered over to her charge naked,
with its attributes and faculties as latent and dormant as those of
the wild rose or dahlia.&nbsp; Through all the ages long, she has worked
upon its development; educating its tastes; taming its appetites; refining
its sensibilities; multiplying and softening its enjoyments; giving
to every sense a new capacity and relish of delight; cultivating the
ear for music, and ravishing it with the concord of sweet sounds; cultivating
the eye to drink in the glorious beauty of the external world, then
adding to natural sceneries ten thousand pictures of mountain, valley,
river, man, angel, and scenes in human and heaven&rsquo;s history, painted
by the thought-instructed hand; cultivating the palate to the most exquisite
sensibilities, and exploring all the zones for luxuries to gratify them;
cultivating the fine finger-nerves to such perception that they can
feel the pulse of sleeping notes of music; cultivating the still finer
organism that catches the subtle odors on the wing, and sends their
separate or mingled breathings through every vein and muscle from head
to foot.</p>
<p>The same law holds good in the development of mind.&nbsp; It has
now reached such an altitude, and it shines with such lustre, that our
imagination can hardly find the way down to the morning horizon of its
life, and measure its scope and power in the dim twilight of its first
hours in time.&nbsp; The simple fact of its first condition would now
seem to most men as exaggerated fancies, if given in the simplest forms
of truthful statement.&nbsp; With all the mighty faculties to which
it has come; with its capacity to count, name, measure and weigh stars
that Adam, nor Moses, nor Solomon ever saw; with all the forces of nature
it has subdued to the service of man, it cannot tell what simplest facts
of the creation had to be ascertained by its first, feeble and confused
reasonings.&nbsp; No one of to-day can say how low down in the scale
of intelligence the human mind began to exercise its untried faculties;
what apposition and deduction of thoughts it required to individualise
the commonest objects that met the eye; even to determine that the body
it animated was not an immovable part of the earth itself; to obtain
fixed notions of distance, of color, light, and heat; to learn the properties
and uses of plants, herbs, and fruits; even to see the sun sink out
of sight with the sure faith that it would rise again.&nbsp; It was
gifted with no instinct, to decide these questions instantly and mechanically.&nbsp;
They had all to pass through the varied processes of reason.&nbsp; The
first bird that sang in Eden, built its first nest as perfectly as its
last.&nbsp; But, thought by thought, the first human mind worked out
conclusions which the dullest beast or bird reached instantly without
reason.&nbsp; What wonderful co-working of internal and external influences
was provided to keep thought in sleepless action; to open, one by one,
the myriad petals of the mind!&nbsp; Nature, with all its shifting sceneries,
filled every new scope of vision with objects that hourly set thought
at play in a new line of reflection.&nbsp; Then, out of man&rsquo;s
physical being came a thousand still small voices daily, whispering,
Think! think!&nbsp; The first-born necessities, few and simple, cried,
&ldquo;<i>Think</i>! for we want bread, we want drink, we want shelter
and raiment against the cold.&rdquo;&nbsp; The finer senses cried continually,
&ldquo;Give! give thought to this, to that.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Eye, the
Ear, the Palate and every other organ that could receive and diffuse
delight, worked the mental faculties by day and night, up to the last
sunset of the antediluvian world; and all the intellectual result of
this working Noah took with him into the ark, and gave to his sons to
hand over to succeeding ages.&nbsp; Flowers that Eve stuck in the hair
of the infant Abel are just now opening the last casket of their beauty
to the favored children of our time.&nbsp; This, in itself, is a marvellous
instance of the law we are noticing.&nbsp; But what is this to the processes
of thought and observation through which the mind of man has reached
its present expansion; through which it has developed all these sciences,
arts, industries and tastes, the literature and the intellectual life
of these bright days of humanity!&nbsp; The figure is weak, and every
figure would be weak when applied to the ratio or the result of this
progression; but, at what future age of time, or of the existence beyond
time, will the mind, that has thus wrought on earth, open its last petal,
put forth no new breathing, unfold no new beauty under the eye of the
Infinite, who breathed it, as an immortal atom of His own essence, into
the being of man?</p>
<p>Follow the radius up into the next concentric circle, and we see
this law working to finer and sublimer issues in man&rsquo;s moral nature.&nbsp;
We have glanced at what the mind has done for and through his physical
faculties and being; how that being has re-acted upon the mind, and
kept all its capacities at work in procuring new delight to the eye,
ear, palate, and all the senses that yearned for enjoyment.&nbsp; We
have noticed how the inside and outside world acted upon his reasoning
powers in the dawn of creation; how slowly they mastered the simplest
facts and phenomena of life in and around them, how slowly they expanded,
through the intervening centuries, to their present development.&nbsp;
The mind is the central personage in the trinity of man&rsquo;s being;
linking the mortal and immortal to its life and action; vitalising the
body with intelligence, until every vein, muscle, and nerve, and function
thrills and moves to the impulse of thought; vitalising the soul with
the vigorous activities of reason, giving hands as well as wings to
its hopes, faiths, loves, and aspirations; giving a faculty of speech,
action, and influence to each, and play to all the tempers and tendencies
of its moral nature.&nbsp; Thus all the influences that the mind could
inhale from the material world through man&rsquo;s physical being, and
all it could draw out of the depths of Divine revelation, were the dew
and the light which it was its mission to bring to the fostering, growth,
and glory of the human soul.&nbsp; These were man&rsquo;s means wherewith
to shape it for its great destiny; these he was to bring to its training
and expansion; with these he was to co-work with the Infinite Father
of Spirits to fit it for His presence and fellowship, just as he co-works
with Nature in developing the latent life and faculties of the rose.&nbsp;
What distillations of spiritual influence have dropped down out of heaven,
through the ages, to help onward this joint work!&nbsp; What histories
of human experience have come in the other direction to the same end!&mdash;fraught
with the emotions of the human heart, from the first sin and sorrow
of Adam to our own griefs, hopes, and joys; and all so many lessons
for the discipline of this high-born nature with us!</p>
<p>And yet how slow and almost imperceptible has been the development
of this nature!&nbsp; How gently and gradually the expanding influences,
human and divine, have been let in upon its latent faculties!&nbsp;
See with what delicate fostering the petals of love, faith, and hope
were taught to open, little by little, their hidden life and beauty,&mdash;taking
Moses&rsquo; history of the process.&nbsp; First, one human being on
the earth, surrounded with beasts and birds that could give him no intelligent
companionship and no fellow-feeling.&nbsp; Then the beautiful being
created to meet these awakening yearnings of his nature; then the first
outflow and interchange of human love.&nbsp; The narrative brings us
to the next stage of the sentiment.&nbsp; Sin and sorrow afflict, but
unite, both hearts in the saddest experience of humanity.&nbsp; They
are driven out of the Eden of their first condition, but their very
sufferings and fears re-Eden their mutual attachments in the very thorns
of their troubles and sorrows.&nbsp; Then another being, of their own
flesh, heir to their changed lot, and to these attachments, is added
to their companionship.&nbsp; The first child&rsquo;s face that heaven
or earth ever saw, opened its baby eyes on them and smiled in the light
of their parental love.&nbsp; The history goes on.&nbsp; In process
of time, there is a family of families, called a community, embracing
hundreds of individuals connected by ties of blood so attenuated that
they possess no binding influence.&nbsp; Common interests, affinities,
and sentiments supply the place of family relationship, and make laws
of amity and equity for them as a population.&nbsp; Next we have a community
of communities, or a commonwealth of these individual populations, generally
called a nation.&nbsp; Here is a lesson for the moral nature.&nbsp;
Here are thousands and tens of thousands of men who never saw each others&rsquo;
faces.&nbsp; Will this expanded orb of humanity revolve around the same
centre as the first family circle, or the first independent community?&nbsp;
How can you give it cohesion and harmony?&nbsp; Extend the <i>radii</i>
of family relationship and influence to its circumference in every direction.&nbsp;
Throne the sovereign in a parent&rsquo;s chair, to execute a father&rsquo;s
laws.&nbsp; He shall treat them as children, and they each other as
brethren.&nbsp; Here is a grand programme for human society.&nbsp; Here
is a vigorous discipline for the wayward will and temper of the human
heart.&nbsp; How is a man to feel and act in these new conditions?&nbsp;
How is he to regulate his hates and loves, his passions and appetites,
to comply properly with these extended and complicated relationships?</p>
<p>About half way from Adam&rsquo;s day to ours, there came an utterance
from Mount Sinai that anticipated and answered these questions once
for all, and for one and all.&nbsp; In that august revelation of the
Divine Mind, every command of the Decalogue swung open upon the pivot
of a <i>not</i>, except one; and that one referred to man&rsquo;s duty
to man, and the promise attached to its fulfilment was only an earthly
enjoyment.&nbsp; All the rest were restrictive; to curb this appetite,
to bar that passion, to hedge this impulse, to check that disposition;
in a word, to hold back the hand from open and positive transgression.&nbsp;
Even the first, relating to His own Godhead and requirements, was but
the first of the series of negatives, a pure and simple prohibition
of idolatry.&nbsp; No reward of keeping this first great law, reaching
beyond the boundary of a temporal condition, was promised at its giving
out.&nbsp; With the headstrong passions, lusts, appetites, and tempers
of flesh and blood bridled and bitted by these restrictions, and with
no motives to obedience beyond the awards of a short life on earth,
the human soul groped its way through twenty centuries after the Revelation
of Sinai, feeling for the immortality which was not yet revealed to
it, even &ldquo;as through a glass darkly.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here and there,
but thinly scattered through the ages, divinely illumined men caught,
through the parting seams of the veil, a transient glimpse and ray of
the life to come.&nbsp; Here and there, obscurely and hesitatingly,
they refer to this vision of their faith.&nbsp; Here and there we seem
to see a hope climbing up out of a good man&rsquo;s heart into the pathless
mystery of a future existence, and bringing back the fragment of a leaf
which it believes must have grown on one of the trees of life immortal.&nbsp;
Moses, Job, David, and Isaiah give us utterances that savor of this
belief; but they leave us in the dark in reference to its influence
upon their lives.&nbsp; We cannot glean from these incidental expressions,
whether it brought them any steady comfort, or sensibly affected their
happiness.</p>
<p>Thus, for four thousand years, the soul of man dashed its wings against
the prison-bars of time, peering into the night through the cold, relentless
gratings for some fugitive ray of the existence of which it had such
strong and sleepless presentiment.&nbsp; It is a mystery.&nbsp; It may
seem irreverent to approach it even with a conjecture.&nbsp; Human reason
should be humble and silent before it, and close its questioning lips.&nbsp;
It may not, however, transcend its prerogative to say meekly, <i>perhaps</i>.&nbsp;
Perhaps, then, for two-thirds of the duration that the sun has measured
off to humanity, that life and immortality which the soul groped after
were veiled from its vision, until all its mental and spiritual faculties
had been trained and strengthened to the ability to grasp and appropriate
the great fact when it should be revealed.&nbsp; Perhaps it required
all the space of forty centuries to put forth feelers and fibres capable
of clinging to the revelation with the steady hold of faith.&nbsp; Perhaps
it was to prove, by long, decisive probation, what the unaided human
mind could do in constructing its idealisms of immortality.&nbsp; Perhaps
it was permitted to erect a scaffolding of conceptions on which to receive
the great revelation at the highest possible level of thought and instinctive
sentiment to which man could attain without supernatural light and help.&nbsp;
If this last <i>perhaps</i> is preferable to the others, where was this
scaffolding the highest?&nbsp; Over Confucius, or Socrates, or the Scandinavian
seer, or Druid or Aztec priest?&nbsp; Was it highest at Athens, because
there the great apostle to the Gentiles planted his feet upon it, and
said, in the ears of the Grecian sophists, &ldquo;Him whom ye ignorantly
worship declare I unto you?&rdquo;&nbsp; At that brilliant centre of
pagan civilization it might have reached its loftiest altitude, measured
by a purely intellectual standard; but morally, this scaffolding was
on the same low level of human life and character all the world around.&nbsp;
The immortalities erected by Egyptian or Grecian philosophy were no
purer, in moral conception and attributes, than the mythological fantasies
of the North American Indians.&nbsp; In them all, human nature was to
have the old play of its passions and appetites; in some of them, a
wider sweep and sway.&nbsp; There was not one in the whole set of Grecian
deities half so moral and pure, in sentiment and conduct, as Socrates;
nor were Jupiter and his subordinate celestials better than the average
kings and courts of Greece.&nbsp; Out of the hay, wood, and stubble
of sheer fancy the human mind was left to raise these fantastic structures.&nbsp;
They exercised and entertained the imagination, but brought no light
nor strength to the soul; no superior nor additional motives to shape
the conduct of life.&nbsp; But they did this, undoubtedly, with all
their delusions; they developed the <i>thought</i> of immortality among
the most benighted races of men.&nbsp; Their most perplexing unrealities
kept the mind restless and almost eager for some supplementary manifestation;
so that, when the Star of Bethlehem shone out in the sky of Palestine,
there were men looking heavenward with expectant eyes at midnight.&nbsp;
From that hour to this, and among pagan tribes of the lowest moral perception,
the heralds of the Great Revelation have found the <i>thought</i> of
another existence active though confused.&nbsp; They have found everywhere
a platform already erected, like that on which Paul stood in the midst
of Mars Hill, and on which they could stand and say to heathen communities,
&ldquo;Him whom ye ignorantly worship declare I unto you!&nbsp; That
future life and immortality which your darkened eyes and hungry souls
have been groping and hungering for, bring we to you, bright as the
sun, in this great gospel of Divine Love.&rdquo;&nbsp; Had the Star
of Bethlehem appeared a century earlier, it might not have met an upturned
eye.&nbsp; If the Saviour of Mankind had come into the world in Solomon&rsquo;s
day, not even a manger might have been found to cradle His first moments
of human life; no Simeon waiting in the temple to greet the great salvation
He brought to our race in His baby hands.</p>
<p>Here, then, commences, as it were, the central era of the soul&rsquo;s
training in time.&nbsp; Here heaven opened upon it the full sunlight
and sunwarmth of its glorious life and immortality.&nbsp; Here fell
upon its opening faculties the dews and rays and spiritual influences
which were to shape its being and destiny.&nbsp; Here commenced such
co-working to this end as can find no measure nor simile in any other
sphere of co-operative activities in the world below or above.&nbsp;
Here the trinity of man and the Trinity of the Godhead came into a co-action
and fellowship overpassing the highest outside wonder of the universe.&nbsp;
And all this co-working, fellowship, and partnership has been repeated
in the experience of every individual soul that has been fitted for
this great immortality.&nbsp; Here, too, this co-working is a law, not
an incident; most marvellously, mightily, and minutely a law, as legislatively
and executively as that which we have seen acting upon the development
of the flower.&nbsp; Had not the great apostle, who was caught up into
the third heavens and heard things unutterable, spoken of this law in
such bold words, it would seem rash and irreverent in us to approach
so near to its sublime revelation.&nbsp; Not ours but his they are;
and it is bold enough in us to repeat them.&nbsp; He said it: that He,
to whose name every knee should bow, and every tongue confess; to whom
belonged and who should possess and rule all the kingdoms of the earth,
&ldquo;was made under the law,&rdquo; not of Moses, not of human nature
only, but under this very law of CO-WORKING.&nbsp; Through this the
world was to be regenerated and filled with His life and light.&nbsp;
Through this a new creation was to be enfolded in the bosom of His glory,
of grander dimensions and of diviner attributes than that over which
the morning stars sang at the birth of time.&nbsp; Said this law to
the individual soul, &ldquo;Work out your salvation with fear and trembling,
for it is God that worketh in you to will and to do of His own good
pleasure.&rdquo;&nbsp; To will and to do.&nbsp; It is His own good will
and pleasure that the soul shall be fitted and lifted up to its high
destiny through this co-working.&nbsp; It was His power to raise it
to that condition without man&rsquo;s participation or conscious acquiescence;
but it was His will and pleasure to enact this law of salvation.&nbsp;
Looking across the circumference of the individual soul, what says this
law?&nbsp; &ldquo;Go ye out into all the world and preach the gospel
to every creature, and, lo, I am with you unto the end,&rdquo;&mdash;not
as an invisible companion, not merely with the still, small voice of
the Comforter to cheer you in trial, weakness and privation; but with
you as a <i>co-worker</i>, with the irresistible energies of the Spirit
of Power.&nbsp; He might have done the whole work alone.&nbsp; He might
have sent forth twelve, and twelve times twelve legions of angels, and
given each a voice as loud as his who is to wake the dead, and bid them
preach His gospel in the ears of every human being.&nbsp; He might have
given a tongue to every breathing of the breeze, an articulate speech
to every ray of light, and sent them out with their ceaseless voices
on the great errand of His love.&nbsp; It was his power to do this.&nbsp;
He did not do it, because it was His will and pleasure to put Himself
under this law we have followed so far; to make men His co-workers in
this new creation, and co-heirs with Him in all its joy and glory.&nbsp;
So completely has He made this law His rule of action, that, for eighteen
hundred years, we have not a single instance in which the life and immortality
which He brought to light have been revealed to a human soul without
the direct and active participation of a human instrumentality.&nbsp;
So completely have His meekest servants on earth put themselves under
this law, that not one of them dares to expect, hope, or pray that He
will reveal Himself to a single benighted heathen mind without this
human co-working.</p>
<p>Thus, begin where you will, in the flower of the field or the hyssop
by the wall, and ascend from sphere to sphere, until there is no more
space in things and beings created to draw another circumferential line,
and you will see the action and the result of this great law of <i>Co-operative
Activities</i>.&nbsp; When I first looked within the lids of that hollyhock,
and was incited to read the rudimental lessons of the new leaves that
man&rsquo;s art had added to its scant, original volume, I had no thought
of finding so much matter printed on its pages.&nbsp; I have transcribed
it here in the order of its paragraphs, hoping that some who read them
may see in this life of flowers an interest they may have partially
overlooked.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p><i>VISIT TO A THREE-THOUSAND-ACRE FARM&mdash;SAMUEL JONAS&mdash;HIS
AGRICULTURAL OPERATIONS, THEIR EXTENT, SUCCESS, AND GENERAL ECONOMY.</i></p>
<p>The rain having ceased, I resumed my walk, in a southerly direction,
to Chrishall Grange, the residence of Samuel Jonas, who may be called
the largest farmer in England; not, perhaps, in extent of territory
occupied, but in the productive capacity of the land cultivated, and
in the values realised from it.&nbsp; It is about four miles east of
Royston, bordering on the three counties of Cambridgeshire, Hertfordshire,
and Essex, though lying mainly in the latter.&nbsp; It contains upwards
of 3,000 acres, and nearly every one of them is arable, and under active
cultivation.&nbsp; It consists of five farms, belonging to four different
landlords; still they are so contiguous and coherent that they form
substantially one great block.&nbsp; No one could be more deeply impressed
with the magnitude of such an establishment, and of the operations it
involves, than a New England farmer.&nbsp; Taking the average of our
agriculturists, their holdings or occupations, to use an English term,
will not exceed 100 acres each; and, including woodland, swamp, and
mountain, not over half of this space can be cultivated.&nbsp; To the
owner and tiller of such a farm, a visit to Mr. Jonas&rsquo; occupation
must be interesting and instructive.&nbsp; Here is a man who cultivates
a space which thirty Connecticut farmers would feel themselves rich
to own and occupy, with families making a population of full two hundred
souls, supporting and filling a church and school-house.&nbsp; In the
great West of America, where cattle are bred and fed somewhat after
the manner of Russian steppes or Mexican ranches, such an occupation
would not be unusual nor unexpected; but in the very heart of England,
containing a space less than the state of Virginia, a tract of such
extent and value in the hands of a single farmer is a fact which a New
Englander must regard at first with no little surprise.&nbsp; He will
not wonder how one man can <i>rent</i> such a space, but how he can
<i>till</i> it to advantage; how, even with the help of several intelligent
and active sons, he can direct and supervise operations which fill the
hands of thirty solid farmers of Massachusetts.&nbsp; Two specific circumstances
enable him to perform this undertaking.</p>
<p>In the first place, agriculture in England is reduced to an exact
and rigid science.&nbsp; To use a nautical phrase, it is all plain sailing.&nbsp;
The course is charted even in the written contract with the landlord.&nbsp;
The very term, &ldquo;<i>course</i>,&rdquo; is adopted to designate
the direction which the English farmer is to observe.&nbsp; Skilled
hands are plenty and pressing to man the enterprise.&nbsp; With such
a chart, and such a force, and such an open sea, it is as easy for him
to sail the &ldquo;Great Eastern&rdquo; as a Thames schooner.&nbsp;
The helm of the great ship plays as freely and faithfully to the motion
of his will as the rudder of the small craft.&nbsp; Then the English
farmer has a great advantage over the American in this circumstance:
he can hire cheaply a grade of labor which is never brought to our market.&nbsp;
Men of great skill and experience, who in America would conduct farms
of their own, and could not be hired at any price, may be had here in
abundance for foremen, at from twelve to sixteen shillings, or from
three to four dollars a week, they boarding and lodging themselves.&nbsp;
And the number of such men is constantly increasing, from two distinct
causes.&nbsp; In the first place there is a large generation of agricultural
laborers in England, now in the prime of manhood, who have just graduated,
as it were, through all the scientific processes of agriculture developed
in the last fifteen years.&nbsp; The ploughmen, cowmen, cartmen, and
shepherds, even, have become familiar with the established routine;
and every set of these hands can produce one or two active and intelligent
laborers who will gladly and ably fill the post of under-foreman for
a shilling or two a week of advanced wages.&nbsp; Then, by the constant
absorption of small holdings into large farms, which is going on more
rapidly from this increased facility of managing great occupations,
a very considerable number of small farmers every year are falling into
the labor market, being reduced to the necessity of either emigrating
to cheaper lands beyond the sea, or of hiring themselves out at home
as managers, foremen or common laborers on the estates thus enlarged
by their little holdings.&nbsp; From these two sources of supply, the
English tenant-farmer, beyond all question, is able to cultivate a larger
space, and conduct more extensive operations than any other agriculturist
in the world, at least by free labor.</p>
<p>The first peculiarity of this large occupation I noticed, was the
extent of the fields into which it was divided.&nbsp; I had never seen
any so large before in England.&nbsp; There were only three of the whole
estate under 60, and some contained more than 400 acres each, giving
the whole an aspect of amplitude like that of a rolling prairie farm
in Illinois.&nbsp; Not one of the little, irregular morsels of land
half swallowed by its broad-bottomed hedging, which one sees so frequently
in an English landscape, could be found on this great holding.&nbsp;
The white thorn fences were new, trim, and straight, occupying as little
space as possible.&nbsp; The five amalgamated farms are light turnip
soil, with the exception of about 200 acres, which are well drained.&nbsp;
The whole surface resembles that of a heavy ground swell of the sea;
nearly all the fields declining gently in different directions.&nbsp;
The view from the rounded crest of the highest wave was exceedingly
picturesque and beautiful, presenting a vista of plenty which Ceres
of classic mythology never saw; for never, in ancient Greece, Italy,
or Egypt, were the crops of vegetation so diversified and contrasting
with each other as are interspersed over an English farm of the present
day.</p>
<p>It is doubtful if 3,000 acres of land, lying in one solid block,
could be found in England better adapted for testing and rewarding the
most scientific and expensive processes of agriculture, than this great
occupation of Mr. Jonas.&nbsp; Certainly, no equal space could present
a less quantity of waste land, or occupy less in hedges or fences.&nbsp;
And it is equally certain that no estate of equal size is more highly
cultivated, or yields a greater amount of production per acre.&nbsp;
Its occupant, also, is what may be called an hereditary farmer.&nbsp;
His father and his remote ancestors were farmers, and he, as in the
case of the late Mr. Webb, has attained to his present position as an
agriculturist by practical farming.</p>
<p>Mr. Jonas cultivates his land on the &ldquo;Four-course system.&rdquo;&nbsp;
This very term indicates the degree to which English agriculture has
been reduced to a precise and rigid science.&nbsp; It means here, that
the whole arable extent of his estate is divided equally between four
great crops; or, wheat, 750 acres; barley and oats, 750; seeds and pulse,
750; and roots, 750.&nbsp; Now, an American farmer, in order to form
an approximate idea of the amount of labor given to the growth of these
crops, must remember that all these great fields of wheat, oats, barley,
turnips, beans, and peas, containing in all over 2,000 acres, are hoed
by hand once or twice.&nbsp; His cereals are all drilled in at seven
inches apart, turnips at seventeen.&nbsp; The latter are horse-hoed
three or four times; and as they are drilled on the flat, or without
ridging the surface of the ground, they are crossed with a horse-hoe
with eight V shaped blades.&nbsp; This operation leaves the plants in
bunches, which are singled out by a troop of children.&nbsp; One hand-hoeing
and two or three more horse-hoeings finish the labor given to their
cultivation.&nbsp; It is remarkable what mechanical skill is brought
to bear upon these operations.&nbsp; In the first place, the plough
cuts a furrow as straight and even as if it were turned by machinery.&nbsp;
A kind of <i>esprit de corps</i> animates the ploughmen to a vigorous
ambition in the work.&nbsp; They are trained to it with as much singleness
of purpose as the smiths of Sheffield are to the forging of penknife
blades.&nbsp; On a large estate like that occupied by Mr. Jonas, they
constitute an order, not of Odd Fellows, but of Straight Furrow-men,
and are jealous of the distinction.&nbsp; When the ground is well prepared,
and made as soft, smooth, and even as a garden, the drilling process
is performed with a judgement of the eye and skill of hand more marvellous
still.&nbsp; The straightness of the lines of verdure which, in a few
weeks, mark the tracks of the seed-tubes, is surprising.&nbsp; They
are drawn and graded with such precision that, when the plants are at
a certain height, a horse-hoe, with eight blades, each wide enough to
cut the whole intervening space between two rows, is passed, hoeing
four or five drills at once.&nbsp; Of course, if the lines of the drill
and hoe did not exactly correspond with each other, whole rows of turnips
would be cut up and destroyed.&nbsp; I saw this process going on in
a turnip field, and thought it the most skilful operation connected
with agriculture that I had ever witnessed.</p>
<p>One of the principal advantages Mr. Jonas realises in cultivating
such an extent of territory, is the ability to economise his working
forces, of man, beast, and agricultural machinery.&nbsp; He saves what
may be called the superfluous fractions, which small farmers frequently
lose.&nbsp; For instance, a man with only fifty acres would need a pair
of stout horses, a plough, cart, and all the other implements necessary
for the growth and gathering of the usual crops.&nbsp; Now, Mr. Jonas
has proved by experience, that, in cultivating his great occupation,
the average force of two and a quarter horses is sufficient for a hundred
acres.&nbsp; Here is a saving of almost one half the expense of horse-force
per acre which the small farmer incurs, and full one half of the use
of carts, ploughs, and other implements.&nbsp; The whole number of horses
employed is about seventy-six; and the number of men and boys about
a hundred.&nbsp; The whole of this great force is directed by Mr. Jonas
and his sons with as much apparent ease and equanimity as the captain
of a Cunarder would manifest in guiding a steamship across the Atlantic.&nbsp;
The helm and ropes of the establishment obey the motion of one mind
with the same readiness and harmony.</p>
<p>A fact or two may serve an American farmer as a tangible measure
whereby to estimate the extent of the operations thus conducted by one
man.&nbsp; To come up to the standard of scientific and successful agriculture
in England, it is deemed requisite that a tenant farmer, on renting
an occupation, should have capital sufficient to invest &pound;10, or
$50, per acre in stocking it with cattle, sheep, horses, farming implements,
fertilisers, etc.&nbsp; Mr. Jonas, beyond a doubt, invests capital after
this ratio upon the estate he tills.&nbsp; If so, then the total amount
appropriated to the land which he <i>rents</i> cannot be less than &pound;30,000,
or nearly $150,000.&nbsp; The inventory of his live stock, taken at
last Michaelmas, resulted in these figures:&mdash;Sheep, &pound;6,581;
horses, &pound;2,487; bullocks, &pound;2,218; pigs, &pound;452; making
a grand total of &pound;11,638.&nbsp; Every animal bred on the estate
is fatted, but by no means with the grain and roots grown upon it.&nbsp;
The outlay for oil-cake and corn purchased for feeding, amounts to about
&pound;4,000 per annum.&nbsp; Another heavy expenditure is about &pound;1,700
yearly for artificial fertilisers, consisting of guano and blood-manure.&nbsp;
Mr. Jonas is one of the directors of the company formed for the manufacture
of the latter.</p>
<p>The whole income of this establishment is realised from two sources&mdash;meat
and grain.&nbsp; And this is the distinguishing characteristic of English
farming generally.&nbsp; Not a pound of hay, straw, or roots is sold
off the estate.&nbsp; Indeed, this is usually prohibited by the conditions
of the contract with the landlord.&nbsp; So completely has Mr. Jonas
adhered to this rule, that he could not give me the market price of
hay, straw, or turnips per ton, as he had never sold any, and was not
in the habit of noticing the market quotations of those products.&nbsp;
I was surprised at one fact which I learned in connection with his economy.&nbsp;
He keeps about 170 bullocks; buying in October and selling in May.&nbsp;
Now, it would occasion an American farmer some wonderment to be told
that this great herd of cattle is fed and fatted almost entirely for
the manure they make.&nbsp; It is doubtful if the difference between
the cost and selling prices averages &pound;2, or $10, per head.&nbsp;
For instance, the bullocks bought in will average &pound;13 or &pound;14.&nbsp;
A ton of linseed-cake and some meal are given to each beast before it
is sent to market, costing from &pound;10 to &pound;12.&nbsp; When sold,
the bullocks average &pound;24 or &pound;25.&nbsp; Thus the cake and
the meal equal the whole difference between the buying and selling price,
so that all the roots, chaff, and attendance go entirely to the account
of manure.&nbsp; These three items, together with the value of pasturage
for the months the cattle may lie in the fields, from October to May
inclusive, could hardly amount to less than &pound;5 per beast, which,
for 170, would be &pound;850.&nbsp; Then &pound;1,700 are paid annually
for guano and artificial manures.&nbsp; Now add the value of the wheat,
oat and barley straw grown on 1,500 acres, and mostly thrown into the
barn-yards, or used as bedding for the stables, and you have one great
division of the fertilising department of Chrishall Grange.&nbsp; The
amount of these three items cannot be less than &pound;3,000.&nbsp;
Then there is another source of fertilisation nearly as productive and
valuable.&nbsp; Upwards of 3,000 sheep are kept on the estate, of which
1,200 are breeding ewes.&nbsp; These are folded, acre by acre, on turnips,
cole, or trefoil, and those fattened for the market are fed with oil-cake
in the field.&nbsp; The locusts of Egypt could not have left the earth
barer of verdure than these sheep do the successive patches of roots
in which they are penned for twenty-four or forty-eight hours, nor could
any other process fertilise the land more thoroughly and cheaply.&nbsp;
Then 76 horses and 200 fattening hogs add their contingent to the manurial
expenditure and production of the establishment.&nbsp; Thus the fertilising
material applied to the estate cannot amount to less than &pound;5,000,
or $24,000, per annum.</p>
<p>Sheep are the most facile and fertile source of nett income on the
estate.&nbsp; Indeed, nearly all the profit on the production of meat
is realised from them.&nbsp; Most of those I saw were Southdowns and
Hampshires, pure or crossed, with here and there a Leicester.&nbsp;
After being well fattened, they fetch in the market about double the
price paid for them as stock sheep.&nbsp; About 2,000, thus fattened,
including lambs, are sold yearly.&nbsp; They probably average about
&pound;2, or $10, per head; thus amounting to the nice little sum of
&pound;4,000 a year, as one of the sources of income.</p>
<p>Perhaps it would be easier to estimate the total expenditure than
the gross income of such an establishment as that of Mr. Jonas.&nbsp;
We have aggregated the former in a lump; assuming that the whole capital
invested in rent, live stock, agricultural machinery, manures, labor
of man and horse, fattening material, etc., amounts to &pound;30,000.&nbsp;
We may extract from this aggregate several estimated items which will
indicate the extent of his operations, putting the largest expenditure
at the head of the list.</p>
<pre>Corn and oil-cake purchased for feeding&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &pound;4,000
Guano and manufactured manures&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  1,700
Labor of 100 men and boys at the average of &pound;20 per annum&nbsp; 2,000
Labor of 76 horses, including their keep, &pound;20 per annum&nbsp; &nbsp; 1,500
Use and wear of steam-engine and agricultural machinery&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 500
Commutation money to men for beer&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 400
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-----
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&pound;10,100</pre>
<p>These are some of the positive annual outlays, without including
rent, interest on capital invested, and other items that belong to the
debit side of the ledger.&nbsp; The smallest on the list given I would
commend to the consideration of every New England farmer who may read
these pages.&nbsp; It is stated under the real fact.&nbsp; The capacity
of English laborers for drinking strong beer is a wonder to the civilised
world.&nbsp; They seem to cling to this habit as to a vital condition
of their very life and being.&nbsp; One would be tempted to think that
malt liquor was a primary and bread a secondary necessity to them; it
must cost them most of the two, at any rate.&nbsp; And generally they
are as particular about the quality as the quantity, and complain if
it is not of &ldquo;good body,&rdquo; as well as full tale.&nbsp; In
many cases the farmer furnishes it to them; sometimes brewing it himself,
but more frequently buying it already made.&nbsp; Occasionally a farmer
&ldquo;commutes&rdquo; with his men; allowing a certain sum of money
weekly in lieu of beer, leaving them to buy and use it as they please.&nbsp;
I understood that Mr. Jonas adopts the latter course, not only to save
himself the trouble of furnishing and rationing such a large quantity
of beer, but also to induce the habit among his men of appropriating
the money he gives them instead of drink to better purposes.&nbsp; The
sum paid to them last year was actually &pound;452, or about $2,200!&nbsp;
Now, it would be quite safe to say, that there is not a farm in the
State of Connecticut that produces pasturage, hay, grain, and roots
enough to pay this beer-bill of a single English occupation!&nbsp; This
fact may not only serve to show the scale of magnitude which agricultural
enterprise has assumed in the hands of such men as Mr. Jonas, but also
to indicate to our American farmers some of the charges upon English
agriculture from which they are exempt; thanks to the Maine Law, or,
to a better one still, that of voluntary disuse of strong drink on our
farms.&nbsp; I do not believe that 100 laboring men and boys could be
found on one establishment in Great Britain more temperate, intelligent,
industrious, and moral than the set employed by Mr. Jonas.&nbsp; Still,
notice the tax levied upon his land by this beer-impost.&nbsp; It amounted
last year to three English shillings, or seventy-two cents, on every
acre of the five consolidated farms, including all the space occupied
by hedges, copses, buildings, etc.&nbsp; Suppose a Maine farmer were
obliged, by an inexorable law of custom, to pay a beer-tax of seventy-two
cents per acre on his estate of 150 acres, or $108, annually, would
he not be glad to &ldquo;commute&rdquo; with his hired men, by leaving
them in possession of his holding and migrating to some distant section
of the country where such a custom did not exist?</p>
<p>The gross income of this great holding it would be more difficult
to estimate.&nbsp; But no one can doubt the yearly issues of Mr. Jonas&rsquo;
balance-sheet, when he has been able to expand his operations gradually
to their present magnitude from the capital and experience acquired
by successful farming.&nbsp; Perhaps the principal sources of revenue
would approximate to the following figures:&mdash;</p>
<pre>&nbsp;2,000 fat sheep and lambs at &pound;2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &pound;4,000
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;150 fat bullocks at &pound;25&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  3,750
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;200 fat pigs = 40,000 lbs., at 4d&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  666
22,500 bushels of wheat, at 6s&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  6,750
&nbsp;9,375 bushels of oats, at 2s&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 937
&nbsp;7,500 bushels of barley, at 3s&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1,125
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-----
Total of these estimated items&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &pound;17,228</pre>
<p>This, of course, is a mere estimate of the principal sources of income
upon which Mr. Jonas depends for a satisfactory result of his balance-sheet.&nbsp;
Each item is probably within the mark.&nbsp; I have put down the crop
of wheat of 750 acres at the average of thirty bushels per acre, and
at 6s. per bushel, which are quite moderate figures.&nbsp; I have assumed
375 acres each for barley and oats, estimating the former at forty bushels
per acre, and the latter at fifty; then reserving half of the two crops
for feeding and fatting the live stock; also all the beans, peas, and
roots for the same purpose.&nbsp; If the estimate is too high on some
items, the products sold, and not enumerated in the foregoing list,
such as cole and other seeds, will rectify, perhaps, the differences,
and make the general result presented closely approximate to the real
fact.</p>
<p>As there is probably no other farm in Great Britain of the same size
so well calculated to test the best agricultural science and economy
of the day as the great occupation of Mr. Jonas, and as I am anxious
to convey to American farmers a well-developed idea of what that science
and economy are achieving in this country, I will dwell upon a few other
facts connected with this establishment.&nbsp; The whole space of 3,000
acres is literally under cultivation, or in a sense which we in New
England do not generally give to that term&mdash;that is, there is not,
I believe, a single acre of permanent meadow in the whole territory.&nbsp;
All the vast amount of hay consumed, and all the pasture grasses have
virtually to be grown like grain.&nbsp; There is so much ploughing and
sowing involved in the production of these grass crops, that they are
called &ldquo;seeds.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus, by this four-course system,
every field passes almost annually under a different cropping, and is
mowed two or three times in ten years.&nbsp; This fact, in itself, will
not only suggest the immense amount of labor applied, but also the quality
and condition of 3,000 acres of land that can be surfaced to the scythe
in this manner.</p>
<p>The <i>seeds</i> or grasses sown by Mr. Jonas for pasturage and hay
are chiefly white and red clover and trefoil.&nbsp; His rule of seeding
is the following:&mdash;</p>
<pre>Wheat,&nbsp; from&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 8 to 10 pecks per acre
Barley, from&nbsp; &nbsp;  12 to 14&nbsp;  &ldquo;&nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;&nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;
Oats,&nbsp;  from&nbsp; &nbsp;  18 to 22&nbsp;  &ldquo;&nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;&nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;
Winter Beans,&nbsp; &nbsp;  8&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &ldquo;&nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;&nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;
Red Clover,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 20 lbs&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;&nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;
White Clover,&nbsp; &nbsp; 16 lbs&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;&nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;
Trefoil,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  30 to 35 lbs.&nbsp;  &ldquo;&nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;</pre>
<p>This, in New England, would be called very heavy seeding, especially
in regard to oats and the grasses.&nbsp; I believe that twelve pecks
of oats to the acre, rather exceed our average rule.&nbsp; Good clover
seed should weigh two pounds to the quart, and eight quarts, or sixteen
pounds, are the usual seeding with us.</p>
<p>As labor of horse and man must be economised to the best advantage
on such an estate, it may be interesting to know the expense of the
principal operations.&nbsp; The cost of ploughing averages 7s. 6d.,
or $1 80c. per acre.&nbsp; For roots, the land is ploughed three or
four times, besides harrowing, drilling, and rolling.&nbsp; The hoeing
of wheat and roots varies from 2s. to 5s., or from 48c. to $1 20c. per
acre.</p>
<p>The sheep are all folded on turnips or grass fields, except the breeding
ewes in the lambing season.&nbsp; The enclosures are made of <i>hurdles</i>,
of which all reading Americans have read, but not one in a thousand
ever has seen.&nbsp; They are a kind of diminutive, portable, post-and-rail
fence, of the New England pattern, made up in permanent <i>lengths</i>,
so light that a stout man might carry two or three of them on his shoulders
at once.&nbsp; The two posts are sawed or split pieces of wood, about
two inches thick, three wide, and from five to six feet in length.&nbsp;
They are generally square-morticed for the rails, which are frequently
what we should call split hoop-holes, but in the best kind are slats
of hard wood, about two and a half inches wide and one in thickness.&nbsp;
Midway between the two posts, the rails are nailed to an upright slat
or brace, to keep them from swaying.&nbsp; Sometimes a farmer makes
his own hurdles, thus furnishing indoor work for his men in winter,
when they cannot labor in the fields; but most generally they are bought
of those who manufacture them on a large scale.&nbsp; Some idea of the
extent of sheep-folding on Chrishall Grange may be inferred from the
fact, that the hurdling on it, if placed in one straight, continuous
line, would reach full ten miles!</p>
<p>A portable steam engine, of twelve-horse power, looking like a common
railway locomotive strayed from its track and taken up and housed in
a farmer&rsquo;s waggon-shed, performs prodigies of activity and labor.&nbsp;
Indeed, search the three realms through and through, and you would hardly
find one on its own legs doing such remarkable varieties of work.&nbsp;
Briareus, with all his fabled faculties, never had such numerous and
supple fingers as this creature of human invention.&nbsp; When set a-going,
they are clattering and whisking and frisking everywhere, on the barn-floor,
on the hay-loft, in the granary, under the eaves, down cellar, and all
this at the same time.&nbsp; It is doubtful if any stationary engine
in a machine shop ever performed more diversified operations at once;
thus proving most conclusively how a farmer may work motive power which
it was once thought preposterous in him to think of using.&nbsp; It
threshes wheat and other kinds of grain at the rate of from 400 to 500
bushels a day; it conveys the straw up to a platform across what we
call the &ldquo;<i>great beams</i>,&rdquo; where it is cut into chaff
and dropped into a great bay, at the trifling expense of sixpence, or
twelve cents, per quantity grown on an acre!&nbsp; While it is doing
this in one direction, it is turning machinery in another that cleans
and weighs the grain off into sacks ready for the market.&nbsp; Open
the doors right and left and you find it at work like reason, breaking
oil-cake, grinding corn for the fat stock, turning the grindstone, pitching,
pounding, paring, rubbing, grabbing, and twisting, threshing, wrestling,
chopping, flopping, and hopping, after the manner of &ldquo;The Waters
of Lodore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The housings for live stock are most admirably constructed as well
as extensive, and all the great yards are well fitted for making and
delivering manure.&nbsp; I noticed here the best arrangement for feeding
swine that I had ever seen before, and of a very simple character.&nbsp;
Instead of revolving troughs, or those that are to be pulled out like
drawers to be cleaned, a long, stationary one, generally of iron, extends
across the whole breadth of the compartment next to the feeding passage.&nbsp;
The board or picket-fence forming this end of the enclosure, from eight
to twelve feet in length, is hung on a pivot at each side, playing in
an iron ring or socket let into each of the upright posts that support
it.&nbsp; Midway in the lower rail of this fence is a drop bolt which
falls into the floor just behind the trough.&nbsp; At the feeding time,
the man has only to raise this bolt and let it fall on the inner side,
and he has the whole length and width of the trough free to clear with
a broom and to fill with the feed.&nbsp; Then, raising the bolt, and
bringing it back to its first place, the operation is performed in a
minute with the greatest economy and convenience.</p>
<p>There was one feature of this great farm home which I regarded with
much satisfaction.&nbsp; It was the housing of the laborers employed
on the estate.&nbsp; This is done in blocks of well-built, well-ventilated,
and very comfortable cottages, all within a stone&rsquo;s throw of the
noble old mansion occupied by Mr. Jonas.&nbsp; Thus, no long and weary
miles after the fatigue of the day, or before its labor begins, have
to be walked over by his men in the cold and dark, as in many cases
in which the agricultural laborer is obliged to trudge on foot from
a distant village to his work, making a hard and sunless journey at
both ends of the day.</p>
<p>Although my visit at this, perhaps the largest, farming establishment
in England, occupied only a few hours, I felt on leaving that I had
never spent an equal space of time more profitably and pleasantly in
the pursuit or appreciation of agricultural knowledge.&nbsp; The open
and large-hearted hospitality and genial manners of the proprietor and
his family seemed to correspond with the dimensions and qualities of
his holding, and to complete, vitalise, and beautify the symmetries
of a true ENGLISH FARMER&rsquo;S HOME.</p>

<p><i>ROYSTON AND ITS SPECIALITIES&mdash;ENTERTAINMENT IN A SMALL VILLAGE&mdash;ST.

INVESTED IN ENGLISH AND AMERICAN AGRICULTURE COMPARED&mdash;ALLOTMENTS
AND GARDEN TENANTRY&mdash;BARLEY GROWN ON OATS.</i></p>
<p>From Chrishall Grange I went on to Royston, where I found very quiet
and comfortable quarters in a small inn called &ldquo;The Catherine
Wheel,&rdquo; for what reason it is not yet clear to my mind, and the
landlady could not enlighten me on the subject.&nbsp; I have noticed
two inns in London of the same name, and have seen it mounted on several
other public houses in England.&nbsp; Why that ancient saint and the
machinery of her torture should be alone selected from the history and
host of Christian martyrs, and thus associated with houses of entertainment
for man and beast, is a mystery which I will not undertake to explore.&nbsp;
To be sure, the head of a puncheon of rum is round like a wheel, and
if the liquor were not too much diluted with water, it might make a
revolving illumination quite interesting, if set on fire and rolled
into the gutter.&nbsp; It may possibly suggest that lambent ignition
of the brain which the fiery drinks of the establishment produce, and
which so many infatuated victims think delightful.&nbsp; Both these
inferences, and all others I could fancy, are so dubious that I will
not venture further into the meaning of this singular appellation given
to a tavern.</p>
<p>Royston is a goodly and comfortable town, just inside the eastern
boundary of Hertfordshire.&nbsp; It has its full share of half-legible
and interesting antiquities, including the ruins of a royal palace,
a cave, and several other broken monuments of the olden time, all festooned
with the web-work of hereditary fancies, legends, and shreds of unravelled
history dyed to the vivid colors of variegated imagination.&nbsp; It
also boasts and enjoys a great, breezy common, large enough to hold
such another town, and which few in the kingdom can show.&nbsp; Then,
if it cannot cope with Glastonbury in showing, to the envious and credulous
world, a thorn-tree planted by Joseph of Arimath&aelig;a, and blossoming
always at Christmas, it can fly a bird of greater antiquity, which never
flapped its wings elsewhere, so far as I can learn.&nbsp; It may be
the lineal descendant of Noah&rsquo;s raven that has come down to this
particular community without a cross with any other branch of the family.&nbsp;
It is called &ldquo;The Royston Crow,&rdquo; and is a variety of the
genus which you will find in no other country.&nbsp; It is a great,
heavy bird, larger than his colored American cousin, and is distinguished
by a white back.&nbsp; Indeed, seen walking at a distance, he looks
like our Bobolink expanded to the size of a large hen-hawk.&nbsp; To
have such a wild bird all to themselves, and of its own free will, notwithstanding
the length and power of its wings, and the force of centrifugal attractions,
is a distinction which the good people of this favored town have good
reason to appreciate at its proper value.&nbsp; Nor are they insensible
to the honor.&nbsp; The town printer put into my hands a monthly publication
called &ldquo;THE ROYSTON CROW,&rdquo; containing much interesting and
valuable information.&nbsp; It might properly have embraced a chapter
on entomology; but, perhaps, it would have been impolitic for the personal
interests of the bird to have given wide publicity to facts in this
department of knowledge.&nbsp; For, after all, there may exist in the
neighborhood certain special kinds of bugs and other insects which lie
at the foundation of his preference for the locality.</p>
<p>The next day I again faced northward, and walked as far as Caxton,
a small, rambling village, which looked as if it had not shaved and
washed its face, and put on a clean shirt for a shocking length of time.&nbsp;
It was dark when I reached it; having walked twelve miles after three
p.m.&nbsp; There was only one inn, properly speaking, in the town, and
since the old coaching time, it had contracted itself into the fag-end
of a large, dark, seedy-looking building, where it lived by selling
beer and other sharp and cheap drinks to the villagers; nineteen-twentieths
of whom appeared to be agricultural laborers.&nbsp; The entertainment
proffered on the sign-board over the door was evidently limited to the
tap-room.&nbsp; Indeed, this and the great, low-jointed and brick-floored
kitchen opening into to it, seemed to constitute all the living or inhabited
space in the building.&nbsp; I saw, at a glance, that the chance for
a bed was faint and small; and I asked Landlord Rufus for one doubtingly,
as one would ask for a ready-made pulpit or piano at a common cabinet-maker&rsquo;s
shop.&nbsp; He answered me clearly enough before he spoke, and he spoke
as if answering a strange and half-impertinent question, looking at
me searchingly, as if he suspected I was quizzing him.&nbsp; His &ldquo;No!&rdquo;
was short and decided; but, seeing I was honest and earnest in the inquiry,
he softened his negative with the explanation that their beds were all
full.&nbsp; It seemed strange to me that this should be so in a building
large enough for twenty, and I hesitated hopefully, thinking he might
remember some small room in which he might put me for the night.&nbsp;
To awaken a generous thought in him in this direction, I intimated how
contented I would be with the most moderate accommodation.&nbsp; But
it was in vain.&nbsp; The house was full, and I must seek for lodging
elsewhere.&nbsp; There were two or three other public houses in the
village that might take me in.&nbsp; I went to them one by one.&nbsp;
They all kept plenty of beer, but no bed.&nbsp; They, too, looked at
me with surprise for asking for such a thing.&nbsp; Apparently, there
had been no demand for such entertainment by any traveller since the
stage-coach ceased to run through the village.&nbsp; I went up and down,
trying to negotiate with the occupants of some of the best-looking cottages
for a cot or bunk; but they had none to spare, as the number of wondering
children that stared at me kindly, at once suggested before I put the
question.</p>
<p>It was now quite dark, and I was hungry and tired; and the prospect
of an additional six miles walk was not very animating.&nbsp; What next?&nbsp;
I will go back to Landlord Rufus and try a new influence on his sensibilities.&nbsp;
Who knows but it will succeed?&nbsp; I will touch him on his true character
as a Briton.&nbsp; So I went back, with my last chance hanging on the
experiment.&nbsp; I told him I was an American traveller, weary, hungry,
and infirm of health, and would pay an extra price for an extra effort
to give me a bed for the night.&nbsp; I did not say all this in a <i>Romanus-civus-sum</i>
sort of tone.&nbsp; No! dear, honest Old Abe, you would have done the
same in my place.&nbsp; I made the great American Eagle coo like a dove
in the request; and it touched the best instincts of the British Lion
within the man.&nbsp; It was evident in a moment that I had put my case
in a new aspect to him.&nbsp; He would talk with the &ldquo;<i>missus</i>;&rdquo;
he withdrew into the back kitchen, a short conference ensued, and both
came out together and informed me that they had found a bed, unexpectedly
vacant, for my accommodation.&nbsp; And they would get up some tea and
bread and butter for me, too.&nbsp; Capital!&nbsp; A sentiment of national
pride stole in between every two feelings of common satisfaction at
this result.&nbsp; The thought would come in and whisper, not for your
importunity as a common fellow mortal were this bed and this loaf unlocked
to you, but because you were an American citizen.</p>
<p>So I followed &ldquo;the missus&rdquo; into that great kitchen, and
sat down in one corner of the huge fire-place while she made the tea.&nbsp;
It was a capacious museum of culinary curiosities of the olden time,
all arranged in picturesque groups, yet without any aim at effect.&nbsp;
Pots, kettles, pans, spits, covers, hooks and trammels of the Elizabethan
period, apparently the heirlooms of several intersecting generations,
showed in the fire-light like a work of artistry; the sharp, silvery
brightness of the tin and the florid flush of burnished copper making
distinct disks in the darkness.&nbsp; It was with a rare sentiment of
comfort that I sat by that fire of crackling faggots, looked up at the
stars that dropped in their light as they passed over the top of the
great chimney, and glanced around at the sides of that old English kitchen,
panelled with plates and platters and dishes of all sizes and uses.&nbsp;
And this fire was kindled and this tea-kettle was singing for me really
because I was an American!&nbsp; I could not forget that&mdash;so I
deemed it my duty to keep up the character.&nbsp; Therefore, I told
the <i>missus</i> and her bright-eyed niece a great many stories about
America; some of which excited their admiration and wonder.&nbsp; Thus
I sat at the little, round, three-legged table, inside the out-spreading
chimney, for an hour or more, and made as cozy and pleasant a meal of
it as ever I ate.&nbsp; Besides all this, I had the best bed in the
house, and several &ldquo;Good nights!&rdquo; on retiring to it, uttered
with hearty good-will by voices softened to an accent of kindness.&nbsp;
Next morning I was introduced into the best parlor, and had a capital
breakfast, and then resumed my walk with a pleasant memory of my entertainment
in that village inn.</p>
<p>I passed through a fertile and interesting section to St. Ives, in
Huntingdonshire.&nbsp; Here I remained with some friends for a week,
visiting neighboring villages by day and returning at night.&nbsp; St.
Ives is a pleasant, well-favored town, just large enough to constitute
a coherent, neighborly, and well-regulated community.&nbsp; It is the
centre-piece of a rich, rural picture, which, without any strikingly
salient features, pleases the eye with lineaments of quiet beauty symmetrically
developed by the artistry of Nature.&nbsp; The river Ouse meanders through
a wide, fertile flat, or what the Scotch would call a strath, which
gently rises on each side into pleasantly undulating uplands.&nbsp;
Parks, groves, copses, and hedge-row trees are interspersed very happily,
and meadow, pasture, and grain-fields seen through them, with villages,
hamlets, farm-houses, and isolated cottages, make up a landscape that
grows more and more interesting as you contemplate it.&nbsp; And this
placid locality, with its peaceful river seemingly sleeping in the bosom
of its long and level meadows, was the scene of Oliver Cromwell&rsquo;s
young, fiery manhood.&nbsp; Here, where Nature invites to tranquil occupations
and even exercises of the mind, he trained the latent energies of his
will for action in the great drama that overturned a throne and transformed
a nation.&nbsp; Here, till very lately, stood his &ldquo;barn,&rdquo;
and here he drilled the first squadron of his &ldquo;Ironsides.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My friend and host drove me one day to see a fen-farm a few miles
beyond Ramsey, at which we remained over night and enjoyed the old-fashioned
English hospitality of the establishment with lively relish.&nbsp; It
was called &ldquo;The Four-Hundred-Acre-Farm,&rdquo; to distinguish
it from a hundred others, laid out on the same dead level, with lines
and angles as straight and sharp as those of a brick.&nbsp; You will
meet scores of persons in England who speak admiringly of the great
prairies of our Western States&mdash;but I never saw one in Illinois
as extensive as the vast level expanse you may see in Cambridgeshire
and Lincolnshire.&nbsp; In fact, the space of a large county has been
fished up out of a shallow sea of salt water by human labor and capital.&nbsp;
I will not dwell here upon the expense, process, and result of this
gigantic operation.&nbsp; It would require a whole chapter to convey
an approximate idea of the character and dimensions of the enterprise.&nbsp;
The feat of Cyrus in turning the current of the Euphrates was the mere
making of a short mill-race compared with the labor of lifting up these
millions of acres bodily out of the flood that had covered and held
them in quiescent solution since the world began.</p>
<p>This Great Prairie of England, generally called here the Fens, or
Fenland, would be an interesting and instructive section for the agriculturists
of our Western States to visit.&nbsp; They would see how such a region
can be made quite picturesque, as well as luxuriantly productive.&nbsp;
Let them look off upon the green sea from one of the upland waves, and
it will be instructive to them to see and know, that all the hedge-trees,
groves, and copses that intersect and internect the vast expanse of
green and gold were planted by man&rsquo;s hands.&nbsp; Such a landscape
would convince them that the prairies of Illinois and Iowa may be recovered
from their almost depressing monotony by the same means.&nbsp; The soil
of this district is apparently the same as that around Chicago&mdash;black
and deep, on a layer of clay.&nbsp; It pulverises as easily in dry weather,
and makes the same inky and sticky composition in wet.&nbsp; To give
it more body, or to cross it with a necessary and supplementary element,
a whole field is often trenched by the spade as clean as one could be
furrowed by the plough.&nbsp; By this process the substratum of clay
is thrown up, to a considerable thickness, upon the light, black, almost
volatile soil, and mixed with it when dry; thus giving it a new character
and capacity of production.</p>
<p>Everything seems to grow on a Californian scale in this fen district.&nbsp;
Although the soil thus rescued from the waters that had flooded and
half dissolved it, was at first as deep, black, and naturally fertile
as that of our prairies, those who commenced its cultivation did not
make the same mistake as did our Western farmers.&nbsp; They did not
throw their manure into the broad draining canals to get rid of it,
trusting to the inexhaustible fertility of the alluvial earth, as did
the wheat growers of Indiana and Illinois to their cost; but they husbanded
and well applied all the resources of their barn-yards.&nbsp; In consequence
of this economy, there is no deterioration of annual averages of their
crops to be recorded, as in some of our prairie States, which have been
boasting of the natural and inexhaustible fertility of their soil even
with the record of retrograde statistics before their eyes.&nbsp; The
grain and root crops are very heavy; and a large business is done in
growing turnip seed for the world in some sections of this fen country.&nbsp;
A large proportion of the quantity we import comes from these low lands.</p>
<p>Our host of the Four-Hundred-Acre Farm took us over his productive
occupation, which was in a very high state of cultivation.&nbsp; The
wheat was yellowing to harvest, and promised a yield of forty-two bushels
to the acre.&nbsp; The oats were very heavy, and the root crops looked
well, especially a field of mangel-wurzel.&nbsp; He apportions his land
to different crops after this ratio:&mdash; Wheat, 120 acres; oats,
80; rye-grass and clover, 50; roots, 60.&nbsp; His live stock consisted
of 300 sheep, 50 to 60 head of cattle, and 70 to 80 hogs.&nbsp; His
working force was from 10 to 12 men, 14 farm horses, and 4 nags.&nbsp;
It may interest some of my American readers to know the number, character,
and cost of the implements employed by this substantial English farmer
in cultivating an estate of 400 acres.&nbsp; I noted down the following
list, when he was showing us his tool-house:&mdash;</p>
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&pound;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $&nbsp; &nbsp;  &pound;&nbsp; &nbsp;  $

6 Horse-carts,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; at 14 each = 70&nbsp; &nbsp; 84 = 420
1 Large Iron Roller and Gearing,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  13 =&nbsp; 65
1 Cambridge Roller&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  14 =&nbsp; 70
1 Twelve-Coulter Drill&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  46 = 230
3 Harrows&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  at&nbsp; 3 each = 15&nbsp; &nbsp;  9 =&nbsp; 45
2 Great Harrows&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  at&nbsp; 3 each = 15&nbsp; &nbsp;  6 =&nbsp; 30
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;---&nbsp; ---
Total cost of these Implements&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &pound;196&nbsp; $980</pre>
<p>These figures will represent the working forces and implemental machinery
of a well-tilled farm of 400 acres in England.&nbsp; They will also
indicate the amount of capital required to cultivate an estate of this
extent here.&nbsp; Let us compare it with the amount generally invested
in New England for a farm of equal size.&nbsp; Thousands that have been
under cultivation for a hundred years, may be bought for &pound;5, or
$25, per acre, including house, barn, and other buildings and appurtenances.&nbsp;
It is a very rare thing for a man with us to buy 400 acres at once;
but if he did, it would probably be on these conditions:&mdash; He would
pay &pound;400, or $2,000, down at the time of purchase, giving his
notes for the remaining &pound;1,600, or $8,000, at 6 per cent. interest
payable annually, together with the yearly instalment of principal specified
in each note.&nbsp; He would perhaps have &pound;200, or $1,000, left
of his capital for working power and agricultural implements.&nbsp;
He would probably divide it after the following manner:&mdash;</p>
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&pound;&nbsp; &nbsp; &pound;&nbsp; &nbsp;  $

6 Shoats, or pigs, six months old&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 10 =&nbsp; 50</pre>
<p>These figures would indicate a large operation for a practical New
England farmer, who should undertake to purchase and cultivate an estate
of 400 acres.&nbsp; Indeed, not one in a hundred buying such a large
tract of land would think of purchasing all the implements on this list
at once, or entirely new.&nbsp; One of his carts, sleds, and harrows
would very probably be &ldquo;second-handed,&rdquo; and bought at half
the price of a new one.&nbsp; Thus, a substantial farmer with us would
think he was beginning on a very satisfactory and liberal footing, if
he had &pound;200, or $1,000, in ready money for stocking a holding
of 400 acres with working cattle and implemental machinery, cows, pigs,
etc.&nbsp; Now, compare this outlay with that of our host of the Four-Hundred-Acre
Farm in Lincolnshire.&nbsp; We will begin with his&mdash;</p>
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&pound;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &pound;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&pound;2,400 $12,200</pre>
<p>The average rent of such land in England must be at least &pound;1
10s. per acre, and the tenant farmer must pay half of this out of the
capital he begins with; which, on 400 acres, would amount to &pound;300.&nbsp;
Then, if he buys a quantity of artificial manures equal to the value
of 10s. per acre, he will need to expend in this department &pound;200.&nbsp;
Next, if he purchases corn and oil-cake at the same ratio for his cattle
and sheep as that adopted by Mr. Jonas, of Chrishall Grange, he will
want &pound;1,000 for his 60 head of cattle and 300 sheep.&nbsp; In
addition to these items of expenditure, he must pay his men weekly;
and the wages of ten, at 10s. per week, for six months, amount to &pound;130.&nbsp;
Add an economical allowance for family expenses for the same length
of time, and for incidental outgoes, and you make up the aggregate of
&pound;4,000, which is &pound;10 to the acre, which an English farmer
needs to have and invest on entering upon the cultivation of a farm,
great or small.&nbsp; This amount, as has been stated elsewhere, is
the rule for successful agriculture in this country.</p>
<p>These facts will measure the difference between the amounts of capital
invested in equal spaces of land in England and America.&nbsp; It is
as ten to one, assuming a moderate average.&nbsp; Here, a man would
need &pound;1,500, or more than $7,000, to begin with on renting a farm
of 150 acres, in order to cultivate it successfully.&nbsp; In New England,
a man would think he began under favorable auspices if he were able
to enter upon the occupancy of equal extent with &pound;100, or about
$500.</p>
<p>On returning from the Fens, I passed the night and most of the following
day at Woodhurst, a village a few miles north of St. Ives, on the upland
rising gently from the valley of the Ouse.&nbsp; My host here was a
farmer, owning the land he tilled, cultivating it and the moral character
and happiness of the little community, in which he moved as a father,
with an equally generous heart and hand, and reaping a liberal reward
from both departments of his labor.&nbsp; He took me over his fields,
and showed me his crops and live stock, which were in excellent condition.&nbsp;
Harvesting had already commenced, and the reapers were at work, men
and women, cutting wheat and barley.&nbsp; Few of them used sickles,
but a curved knife, wider than the sickle, of nearly the same shape,
minus the teeth.&nbsp; A man generally uses two of them.&nbsp; With
the one in his left hand he gathers in a good sweep of grain, bends
it downward, and with the other strikes it close to the ground, as we
cut Indian corn.&nbsp; With the left-hand hook and arm, he carries on
the grain from the inside to the outside of the swath or &ldquo;work,&rdquo;
making three or four strokes with the cutting knife; then, at the end,
gathers it all up and lays it down in a heap for binding.&nbsp; This
operation is called &ldquo;bagging.&rdquo;&nbsp; It does not do the
work so neatly as the sickle, and is apt to pull up many stalks by the
roots with the earth attaching to them, especially at the last, outside
stroke.</p>
<p>I was struck with the economy adopted by my host in loading, carting
and stacking or ricking his grain.&nbsp; The operation was really performed
like clock-work.&nbsp; Two or three men were stationed at the rick to
unload the carts, two in the fields to load them, and several boys to
lead them back and forth to the two parties.&nbsp; They were all one-horse
carts, and so timed that a loaded one was always at the rick and an
empty one always in the field; thus keeping the men at both ends fully
employed from morning until night, pitching on and pitching off; while
boys, at 6d. or 8d. a day, led the horses.</p>
<p>On passing through the stables and housings for stock, I noticed
a simple, yet ingenious contrivance for watering cattle, which I am
not sure I can describe accurately enough, without a drawing, to convey
a tangible idea of it to my agricultural neighbors in America.&nbsp;
It may be called the <i>buoy-cock</i>.&nbsp; In the first place, the
water is brought into a cistern placed at one end of the stable or shed
at a sufficient elevation to give it the necessary fall in all the directions
in which it is to be conducted.&nbsp; The pipe used for each cow-box
or manger connects each with the cistern, and the distributing end of
it rests upon, or is suspended over, the trough assigned to each animal.&nbsp;
About one-third of this trough, which was here a cast-iron box, about
twelve inches deep and wide, protrudes through the boarding of the stable.&nbsp;
In this outside compartment is placed a hollow copper ball attached
to a lever, which turns the axle or pivot of the cock.&nbsp; Now, this
little buoy, of course, rises and falls with the water in the trough.&nbsp;
When the trough is full, the buoy rises and raises the lever so as to
shut off the water entirely.&nbsp; At every sip the animal takes, the
buoy descends and lets on again, to a drop, a quantity equal to that
abstracted from the inside compartment.&nbsp; Thus the trough is always
kept full of pure water, without losing a drop of it through a waste-pipe
or overflow.&nbsp; Where a great herd of cattle and a drove of horses
have to be supplied from a deep well, as in the case of Mr. Jonas, at
Chrishall Grange, this <i>buoy-cock</i> must save a great amount of
labor.</p>
<p>I saw also here in perfection that garden allotment system which
is now coming widely into vogue in England, not only adjoining large
towns like Birmingham, but around small villages in the rural districts.&nbsp;
It is well worthy of being introduced in New England and other states,
where it would work equally well in various lines of influence.&nbsp;
A landowner divides up a field into allotments, each generally containing
a rood, and lets them to the mechanics, tradespeople and agricultural
laborers of the town or village, who have no gardens of their own for
the growth of vegetables.&nbsp; Each of these is better than a savings-bank
to the occupant.&nbsp; He not only deposits his odd pennies but his
odd hours in it; keeping both away from the public-house or from places
and habits of idleness and dissipation.&nbsp; The days of Spring and
Summer here are very long, and a man can see to work in the field as
early as three o&rsquo;clock in the morning, and as late as nine at
night.&nbsp; So every journeyman blacksmith, baker or shoemaker may
easily find four or five hours in the twenty-four for work on his allotment,
after having completed the task or time due to his employer.&nbsp; He
generally keeps a pig, and is on the <i>qui vive</i> to make and collect
all the manure he can for his little farm.&nbsp; A field of several
acres, thus divided and cultivated in allotments, presents as striking
a combination of colors as an Axminster carpet.&nbsp; As every rood
is subdivided into a great variety of vegetables, and as forty or fifty
of such patches, lying side by side, present, in one <i>coup d&rsquo;&oelig;il</i>,
all the alternations of which these crops and colors are susceptible,
the effect is very picturesque.</p>
<p>My Woodhurst friend makes his allotment system a source of much social
enjoyment to himself and the poor villagers.&nbsp; He lets forty-seven
patches, each containing twenty poles.&nbsp; Every tenant pays 10s.,
or $2 40c., annual rent for his little holding, Mr. E. drawing the manure
for each, which is always one good load a year.&nbsp; Here, too, these
little spade-farmers are put under the same <i>regime</i> as the great
tenant agriculturists of the country.&nbsp; Each must farm his allotment
according to the terms of the yearly lease.&nbsp; He must dig up his
land with spade or pick, not plough it; and he is not allowed to work
on it upon the Sabbath.&nbsp; But encouragements greatly predominate
over restrictions, and stimulate and reward a high cultivation.&nbsp;
<i>Eight</i> prizes are offered to this end, of the following amounts:&mdash;10s.,
7s. 6d., 5s., 4s., 3s., 2s. 6d., 2s. and 1s.&nbsp; Every one who competes
must not have more than half his allotment in potatoes.&nbsp; The greater
the variety of vegetables the other half contains, the better is his
chance for the first prize.&nbsp; The appraiser is some disinterested
person of good judgment, perhaps from an adjoining town, who knows none
of the competitors.&nbsp; To prevent any possible favoritism, the allotments
are all numbered, and he awards prizes to numbers only, not knowing
to whom they belong.&nbsp; Another feature, illustrating the generous
disposition of the proprietor, characterises this good work.&nbsp; On
the evening appointed for paying the rents, he gets up a regular, old-fashioned
English supper of roast beef and plum-pudding for them, giving each
fourpence instead of beer, so that they may all go home sober as well
as cheerful.&nbsp; To see him preside at that table, with his large,
round, rosy face beaming upon them with the quiet benevolence of a good
heart, and to hear the fatherly and neighborly talks he makes to them,
would be a picture and preaching which might be commended to the farmers
of all countries.</p>
<p>I saw also a curious phenomenon in the natural world on this farm,
which perhaps will be regarded as a fiction of fancy by many a reader.&nbsp;
It was a large field of barley grown from <i>oats</i>!&nbsp; We have
recently dwelt upon some of the co-workings of Nature and Art in the
development of flowers and of several useful plants.&nbsp; But here
is something stranger still, that seems to diverge from the line of
any law hitherto known in the vegetable world.&nbsp; Still, for aught
one can know at this stage of its action, it may be the same general
law of development which we have noticed, only carried forward to a
more advanced point of progress.&nbsp; I would commend it to the deep
and serious study of naturalists, botanists, or to those philosophers
who should preside over the department of investigation to which the
subject legitimately belongs.&nbsp; I will only say what I saw with
my own eyes and heard with my own ears.&nbsp; Here, I repeat, was a
large field of heavy grain, ready for harvest.&nbsp; The head and berry
were <i>barley</i>, and the stalk and leaves were <i>oat</i>!&nbsp;
Here, certainly, is a mystery.&nbsp; The barley sown on this field was
the first-born offspring of oats.&nbsp; And the whole process by which
this wonderful transformation is wrought, is simply this, and nothing
more:&mdash;The oats are sown about the last week in June; and, before
coming into ear, they are cut down within one inch and a half of the
ground.&nbsp; This operation is repeated a second time.&nbsp; They are
then allowed to stand through the winter, and the following season the
produce is <i>barley</i>.&nbsp; This is the plain statement of the case
in the very words of the originator of this process, and of this strange
transmutation.&nbsp; The only practical result of it which he claims
is this: that the straw of the barley thus produced is stouter, and
stands more erect, and, therefore, less liable to be beaten down by
heavy wind or rain.&nbsp; Then, perhaps, it may be added, this oat straw
headed with barley is more valuable as fodder for live stock than the
natural barley straw.&nbsp; But the value of this result is nothing
compared with the issue of the experiment as proving the existence of
a principle or law hitherto undiscovered, which may be applied to all
kinds of plants for the use of man and beast.&nbsp; If any English reader
of these notes is disposed to inquire more fully into this subject,
I am sure he may apply without hesitation to Mr. John Ekins, of Bruntisham,
near St. Ives, who will supply any additional information needed.&nbsp;
He presented me with a little sample bag of this oat-born barley, which
I hope to show my agricultural neighbors on returning to America.</p>

TAPESTRY AND WORKS OF ART&mdash;&ldquo;THE OLD MERMAID&rdquo; AND &ldquo;THE
GREEN MAN&rdquo;&mdash;TALK WITH AGRICULTURAL LABORERS&mdash;THOUGHTS
ON THEIR CONDITION, PROSPECTS, AND POSSIBILITIES.</i></p>
<p>After a little more than a week&rsquo;s visit in St. Ives and neighboring
villages, I again resumed my staff and set out in a westerly direction,
in order to avoid the flat country which lay immediately northward for
a hundred miles and more.&nbsp; Followed the north bank of the Ouse
to Huntingdon.&nbsp; On the way, I stopped and dined with a gentleman
in Houghton whose hospitality and good works are well known to many
Americans.&nbsp; The locality mentioned is so identified with his name,
that they will understand whom I mean.&nbsp; There was a good and tender-hearted
man who lived in our Boston, called Deacon Grant; and I hope he is living
still.&nbsp; He was so kind to everybody in trouble, and everybody in
trouble went to him so spontaneously for sympathy and relief, that no
one ever thought of him as belonging to a single religious congregation,
but regarded him as Deacon of the whole of Boston&mdash;a kind of universal
father, whose only children were the orphans and the poor men&rsquo;s
sons and daughters of the city.&nbsp; The Miller of Houghton, as some
of my readers will know, is just such another man, with one slight difference,
which is to his advantage, as a gift of grace.&nbsp; He has all of Deacon
Grant&rsquo;s self-diffusing life of love for his kind, generous and
tender dispositions towards the poor and needy, and more than the Deacon&rsquo;s
means of doing good; and, with all this, the indomitable energy and
will and even the look of Cromwell.&nbsp; During my stay in the neighborhood,
I was present at two large gatherings at his House of Canvas, with which
he supplements his family mansion when the latter lacks the capacity
of his heart in the way of accommodation.&nbsp; This tent, which he
erects on his lawn, will hold a large congregation; and, on both the
occasions to which I refer, was well filled with men, women, and children
from afar and near.&nbsp; The first was a re-union of the Sunday-school
teachers and pupils of the county, to whom he gave a sumptuous dinner;
after which followed addresses and some business transactions of the
association.&nbsp; The second was the examination of the British School
of the village, founded and supported, I believe, by himself.&nbsp;
At the conclusion of the exercises, which were exceedingly interesting,
the whole company, young and old, adjourned to the lawn, where the visitors
and elder people of the place were served with tea and coffee under
the tent.</p>
<p>Then came &ldquo;The Children&rsquo;s Hour.&rdquo;&nbsp; They were
called in from their games and romping on the lawn, and formed into
a circle fifty feet in diameter.&nbsp; And here and now commenced an
entertainment which would make a more interesting picture than the old
Apsley House Dinner.&nbsp; The good deacon of the county, with several
assistants, entered this charmed circle of boys and girls, all with
eyes dilated and eager with expectation, and overlooked by a circular
wall of elder people radiant with the spirit of the moment.&nbsp; The
host, in his white hat and grey beard, led the way with a basket on
his arm, filled with little cakes, called with us gingernuts.&nbsp;
He was followed by a file of other men with baskets of nuts, apples,
etc.&nbsp; It was a most hilarious scene, exhilarating to all the senses
to look upon, either for young or old.&nbsp; He walked around the ring
with a grand, Cromwellian step, sowing a pattering rain of the little
cakes on the clean-shaven lawn, as a farmer would sow wheat in his field,
broadcast, in liberal handfuls.&nbsp; Then followed in their order the
nut-sowers, apple-sowers, and the sowers of other goodies.&nbsp; When
the baskets were emptied, the circular space enclosed was covered with
as tempting a spread of dainties as ever fascinated the eyes of a crowd
of little people.&nbsp; For a whole minute, longer than a full hour
of ordinary schoolboy enjoyments, they had to stand facing that sight,
involuntarily attitudinising for the plunge.&nbsp; At the end of that
long minute, the signal sounded, and, in an instant, there was a scene
in the ring that would have made the soberest octogenarian shake his
sides with the laughter of his youth.&nbsp; The encircling multitude
of youngsters darted upon the thickly-scattered delicacies like a flock
of birds upon a field of grain, with patter, twitter and flutter, and
a tremor and treble of little short laughs; small, eager hands trying
in vain to shut fast upon a large apple and several ginger-nuts at one
grasp; slippings and trippings, tousling of tresses and crushing of
dresses; boys and girls higgledy-piggledy; caps and bonnets piggledy-higgledy;
little, red-faced Alexanders looking half sad, because they had filled
their small pocket-worlds and both hands with apples and nuts, and had
no room nor holding for more; little girls, with broken bonnet-strings,
and long, sunny hair dancing over their eyes, stretching their short
fingers to grasp another goodie,&mdash;all this, with the merry excitement
of fathers and mothers, elder brothers and sisters, and other spectators,
made it a scene of youthful life and delight which would test the genius
of the best painters of the age to delineate.&nbsp; And Sir Roger Coverley
Cromwell, the author of all this entertainment, would make a capital
figure in the group, taken just as he looked at that moment, with his
face illuminated with the upshooting joy of his heart, like the clear,
frosty sky of winter with the glow and the flush of the Northern Lights.</p>
<p>The good Miller of Houghton, having added stone to stone until his
mills can grind all the wheat the largest county can grow, has recently
handed over to his sons the great business he had built up to such magnitude,
and retired, if possible, to a more active life of benevolence.&nbsp;
One of his late benefactions was a gift of &pound;3,000, or nearly $15,000,
toward the erection of an Independent Chapel in St. Ives.</p>
<p>At Huntingdon, I took tea and spent a pleasant hour with the principal
of a select school, kept in a large, dignified and comfortable mansion,
once occupied by the poet Cowper.&nbsp; In the yard behind the house
there is a wide-spreading and prolific pear-tree planted by his hands.&nbsp;
This, too, was one of the thousands of old, stately dwellings you meet
with here and there, which have no beginning nor end that you can get
at.&nbsp; Cowper lived and wrote in this, for instance; but who lived
in it a century before he was born?&nbsp; Who built it?&nbsp; Which
of the Two Roses did he mount on his arms?&nbsp; Or did he live and
build later, and dine his townsman, the great Oliver, or was he loyal
to the last to Charles the First?&nbsp; These are questions that come
up, on going over such a building, but no one can answer them, and you
are left to the wisdom of limping legends on the subject.&nbsp; The
present occupant has an antiquarian <i>penchant</i>; so, a short time
after he took possession of the house, he began to make explorations
in the walls and wainscotings, as men of the same mind have done at
Nineveh and Pompeii.&nbsp; Having penetrated a thick surface of white
lava, or a layer of lime, put on with a brush &ldquo;in an earlier age
than ours,&rdquo; he came upon a gorgeous wall of tapestry, with inwoven
figures and histories of great men and women, quite as large as life,
and all of very florid complexion and luxurious costumes.&nbsp; He has
already exhumed a great many square yards of this picturesque fabric,
wrought in by-gone ages, and is continuing the work with all the zest
and success of a fortunate arch&aelig;ologist.&nbsp; Now it is altogether
probable, that Cowper, as he sat in one of those rooms writing at his
beautiful rhymes, had not the slightest idea that he was surrounded
by such a crowd of kings, queens, and other great personages, barely
concealed behind a thin cloud of white-wash.</p>
<p>It may possibly be true, that a few beautiful, fair-haired heretics
in love or religion have been stone-masoned up alive in the walls of
abbeys or convents.&nbsp; Sir Walter Scott leaned to that belief, and
perhaps had credible history for it.&nbsp; But if the trowel has slain
its thousands, the whitewash swab has slain its ten thousands of innocents.&nbsp;
Think of the furlongs of richly-wrought tapestry, full of sacred and
profane history, and the furlongs of curiously-carved panels, wainscoting,
and cornice that floppy, sloppy, vandal brush of pigs&rsquo; bristles
and pail of diluted lime have eclipsed and obliterated for ever, and
not a retributive drop of the villainous mixture has fallen into the
perpetrator&rsquo;s eye to &ldquo;make his foul intent seem horrible!&rdquo;&nbsp;
Think of Christian kings of glorious memory, even Defenders of the Faith,
with their fair queens, princes of the blood, and knights, noble and
brave, all, in one still St. Bartholomew night of that soft, thin, white
flood, buried from the sight of the living as completely as the Roman
sentinel at his post by the red gulf-stream of Vesuvius!&nbsp; Still,
we must not be too hard on these seemingly barbarous transactions.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Not in anger, not in wrath,&rdquo; nor in foolish fancy, was
that dripping brush always lifted upon these works of art.&nbsp; Many
a person of cultivated taste saw a time when he could say, almost with
Sancho Panza, &ldquo;blessings on the man who invented whitewash!&nbsp;
It covers a tapestry, a carving, or a sculpture all over like a blanket;&rdquo;
like that one spoken of in Macbeth.&nbsp; England is just beginning
to learn what treasures of art in old mansions, churches and cathedrals
were saved to the present age by a timely application of that cheap
and healthy fluid.&nbsp; For there was a time when stern men of iron
will arose, who had no fear of Gothic architecture, French tapestry,
or Italian sculpture before their eyes; who treated things that had
awed or dazzled the world as &ldquo;baubles&rdquo; of vanity, to be
put away, as King Josiah put away from his realm the graven images of
his predecessors.&nbsp; And these men thought they were doing good service
to religion by pushing their bayonets at the most delicate works of
the needle, pencil and chisel; ripping and slitting the most elaborately
wrought tapestry,&mdash;stabbing off the fine leaf, and vine-work from
carved cornices and wainscoting, and mutilating the marble lace-work
of the sculptor in the old cathedrals.&nbsp; The only way to save these
choice things was to make them suddenly take the white veil from the
whitewasher&rsquo;s brush.&nbsp; Thousands of them were thus preserved,
and they are now being brought forth to the light again, after having
been shut away from the eye of man for several centuries.</p>
<p>The school-house is still standing in Huntingdon, in good condition
and busy occupation, in which Oliver Cromwell stormed the English alphabet
and carried the first parallel of monosyllables at the point of the
pen.&nbsp; The very form or bench of oak from which he mounted the breach
is still occupied by boys of the same size and age, with the same number
of inches between their feet and the floor which separated it from his.&nbsp;
Had the photographic art been discovered in his day, we might have had
his face and form as he looked when seated as a rosy-faced, light-haired
boy in the rank and file of the youngsters gathered within those walls.&nbsp;
What an overwhelming revelation it would have been to his young, honest
and merry mind, if some seer, like him who told Hazael his future, could
have given him a sudden glimpse of what he was to be and do in his middle
manhood!</p>
<p>After tea, I continued my walk westward to a small, quiet, comfortable
village, about five miles from Huntingdon, where I became the guest
of &ldquo;The Old Mermaid,&rdquo; who extended her amphibious hospitalities
to all strangers wishing bed and board for the night.&nbsp; Both I received
readily and greatly enjoyed under her roof, especially the former.&nbsp;
Never did I occupy a bed so fringed with the fanciful artistries of
dreamland.&nbsp; It was close up under the thatched roof, and it was
the most easy and natural thing in the world for the fancies of the
midnight hour to turn that thatching into hair, and to cheat my willing
mind with the delusion that I was sleeping with the long, soft tresses
of Her Submarine Ladyship wound around my head.&nbsp; It was a delightful
vagary of the imagination, which the morning light, looking in through
the little checker-work window, gently dispelled.</p>
<p>The next day I bent my course in a north-westerly direction, and
passed through a very fertile and beautiful section.&nbsp; The scenery
was truly delightful;&mdash;not grand nor splendid, but replete with
quiet pictures that please the eye and touch the heart with a sense
of gladness.&nbsp; The soft mosaic work of the gently rounded hills,
or figures wrought in wheat, barley, oats, beans, turnips, and meadow
and pasture land, and grouped into landscapes in endless alternation
of lights and shades, and all this happy little world now veiled by
the low, summer clouds, now flooded by a sunburst between them&mdash;all
these lovely and changing sceneries made my walk like one through a
continuous gallery of paintings.</p>
<p>Harvesting had commenced in real earnest, and the wheat-fields were
full of reapers, some wielding the sickle, others the scythe.&nbsp;
When I saw men and women bending almost double to cut their sheaves
close to the ground, I longed to walk through a barley-field with one
of our American cradles, and show them how we do that sort of thing.&nbsp;
As yet I have seen no reaping machines in operation, and I doubt if
they will ever come into such extensive use here as with us, owing to
the abundance of cheap labor in this country.&nbsp; I saw on this day&rsquo;s
walk the heaviest crop of wheat that I have noticed since I left London.&nbsp;
It must have averaged sixty bushels to the acre for the whole field.</p>
<p>Late in the afternoon it began to rain; and I was glad to find shelter
and entertainment at a comfortable village inn, under the patronage
of &ldquo;The Green Man,&rdquo; perhaps a brother or near relative of
Mermadam my hostess that entertained me the preceding night.&nbsp; It
was a unique old building, or rather a concrete of a great variety of
buildings devoted to a remarkable diversity of purposes, including brewing,
farming, and other occupations.&nbsp; The large, low, dark kitchen was
flanked by one of the old-fashioned fire-places, with space for a large
family between the jambs, and the hollow of the chimney ample enough
to show one of the smaller constellations at the top of it in a clear
night.&nbsp; A seat on the brick or stone floor before one of these
kitchen fire-places is to me the focus of the home comforts of the house,
and I always make for it mechanically.&nbsp; As the darkness drew on,
several agricultural laborers drifted in, one after the other, until
the broad, deep pavement of the hearth was lined by a row of them, quite
fresh from their work.&nbsp; They were quiet, sober-looking men, and
they spoke with subdued voices, without animation or excitement, as
if the fatigue of the day and the general battle of life had softened
them to a serious, pensive mood and movement.&nbsp; As they sat drying
their jackets around the fire, passing successive mugs of the landlord&rsquo;s
ale from one to the other, they grew more and more conversational; and,
as I put in a question here and there, they gave me an insight into
the general condition, aspects and prospects of their class which I
had not obtained before.&nbsp; They were quite free to answer any questions
relating to their domestic economy, their earnings, spendings, food,
drink, clothing, housing and fuel, also in reference to their educational
and religious privileges and habits.</p>
<p>It was now the first week of harvest; and harvest in England, in
any one locality, covers the space of a full month, in ordinary weather.&nbsp;
Then, as the season varies remarkably, so that one county is frequently
a week earlier in harvesting than that adjoining it on the north, the
work for the sickle is often prolonged from the middle of July to the
middle of September.&nbsp; This is the period of great expectation as
well as toil for the agricultural laborers.&nbsp; Every man, woman,
and boy of them is all put under the stimulus of extra earnings through
these important weeks.&nbsp; Even the laborers hired by the year have
a full month given them for harvesting forty or fifty extra shillings
under this stimulus.&nbsp; Nearly all the grain in England is cut for
a certain stipulated sum per acre; and thousands of all ages, with sickle
or scythe in hand, see the sun rise and set while they are at work in
the field.&nbsp; In the field they generally breakfast, lunch, and dine;
and when it is considered there is daylight enough for labor between
half-past three in the morning to half-past eight at night, one may
easily see how many of the twenty-four hours they may bend to their
toil.&nbsp; The price for cutting and binding wheat is from 10s. to
14s., or from $2 40c. to $3 36c. per acre, and 8s., or $1 92c. per acre
for oats and barley.&nbsp; The men who cut, bind, and shock by the acre
generally have to find their own beer, and will earn from 24s. to 28s.,
or from $5 76c. to $6 72c. per week.&nbsp; The regular laborers frequently
let themselves to their employers during the harvest month at from 20s.
to 24s. per week, which is just about double their usual wages.&nbsp;
In addition to this pay, they are often allowed two quarts of ale and
two quarts of small beer per day; not the small beer of New England,
made only of hops, ginger, and molasses; but a far more stimulating
drink, quite equal to our German <i>lager</i>.&nbsp; This gallon of
beer will cost the farmer about 10d., or 20c.&nbsp; Where the piece-work
laborer furnishes his own malt liquor, it must cost him on an average
about an English shilling, or twenty-four cents, a day.</p>
<p>Two or three of the men who formed the circle around the fire at
The Green Man, had come to purchase, or pay for, a keg of beer for their
harvest allowance.&nbsp; It was to me a matter of half-painful interest
to see what vital importance they attached to a supply of this stimulant&mdash;to
see how much more they leaned upon its strength and comfort than upon
food.&nbsp; It was not in my heart to argue the question with them,
or to seek to dispel the hereditary and pleasant illusion, that beer
alone, of all human drinks, could carry them through the long, hot hours
of toil in harvest.&nbsp; Besides, I wished to get at their own free
thoughts on the subject without putting my own in opposition to them,
which might have slightly restricted their full expression.&nbsp; Every
one of them held to the belief, as put beyond all doubt or question
by the experience of the present and all past generations, that wheat,
barley and oats could not be reaped and ricked without beer, and beer
at the rate of a gallon a day per head.&nbsp; Each had his string of
proofs to this conviction terminating in a pewter mug, just as some
poor people praying to the Virgin have a string of beads ending in a
crucifix, which they tell off with honest hearts and sober faces.&nbsp;
Each could make it stand to reason that a man could not bear the heat
and burden of harvest labor without beer.&nbsp; Each had his illustration
in the case of some poor fellow who had tried the experiment, out of
principle or economy, and had failed under it.&nbsp; It was of no use
to talk of temperance and all that.&nbsp; It was all very nice for well-to-do
people, who never blistered their hands at a sickle or a scythe, to
tell poor, laboring men, sweating at their hot and heavy work from sun
to sun, that they must not drink anything but milk and water or cold
tea and coffee, but put them in the wheat-field a few days, and let
them try their wishy-washy drinks and see what would become of them.&nbsp;
As I have said, I did not undertake to argue the men out of this belief,
partly because I wished to learn from them all they thought and felt
on the subject, and partly, I must confess, because I was reluctant
to lay a hard hand upon a source of comfort which, to them, holds a
large portion of their earthly enjoyments, especially when I could not
replace it with a substitute which they would accept, and which would
yield them an equal amount of satisfaction.</p>
<p>A personal habit becomes a &ldquo;second nature&rdquo; to the individual,
even if he stands alone in its indulgence.&nbsp; But when it is an almost
universal habit, coming down from generation to generation, throwing
its creepers and clingers around the social customs and industrial economies
of a great nation, it is almost like re-creating a world to change that
second nature thus strengthened.&nbsp; This change is slowly working
its way in Great Britain&mdash;slowly, but perceptibly here and there&mdash;thanks
to the faithful and persevering efforts put forth by good and true men,
to enlighten the subjects of this impoverishing and demoralising custom,
which has ruled with such despotism over the laborers of the land.&nbsp;
Little by little the proper balance between the Four Great Powers of
human necessity,&mdash;Food, Drink, Raiment and Housing, so long disturbed
by this habit, is being restored.&nbsp; Still, the preponderance of
Drink, especially among the agricultural laborers in England, is very
striking and sad.&nbsp; As a whole, Beer must still stand before Bread&mdash;even
before Meat, and before both in many cases, in their expenditures.&nbsp;
The man who sat next me, in muddy leggings, and smoking coat, was mildly
spoken, quiet, and seemingly thoughtful.&nbsp; He had come for his harvest
allowance of 20s. worth of beer.&nbsp; If he abstained from its use
on Sundays, he would have a ration of about tenpence&rsquo;s worth daily.&nbsp;
That would buy him a large loaf of bread, two good cuts of mutton or
beef, and all the potatoes and other vegetables he could eat in a day.&nbsp;
But he puts it all into the Jug instead of the Basket.&nbsp; Jug is
the juggernaut that crushes his hard earnings in the dust, or, without
the figure, distils them into drink.&nbsp; Jug swallows up the first
fruits of his industry, and leaves Basket to glean among the sharpest
thorns of his poverty.&nbsp; Jug is capricious as well as capacious.&nbsp;
It clamors for quality as well as quantity; it is greedy of foaming
and beaded liquors.&nbsp; Basket does well if it can bring to the reaper
the food of well-kept dogs.&nbsp; In visiting different farms, I have
noticed men and women at their luncheons and dinners in the field.&nbsp;
A hot mutton chop, or a cut of roast-beef, and a hot potato, seem to
be a luxury they never think of in the hardest toil of harvest.&nbsp;
Both the meals I have mentioned consist, so far as I have seen, of only
two articles of food,&mdash;bread and bacon, or bread and cheese.&nbsp;
And this bacon is never warm, but laid upon a slice of bread in a thin,
cold layer, instead of butter, both being cut down through with a jack-knife
into morsels when eaten.</p>
<p>Such is a habit that devours a lion&rsquo;s share of the English
laborer&rsquo;s earnings, and leaves Food, Raiment, and Housing to shift
for themselves.&nbsp; If he works by the piece and finds his own beer,
it costs him more than he pays for house rent, or for bread, or meat,
or for clothes for himself and family.&nbsp; If his employer furnishes
it or pays him commutation money, it amounts for all his men to a tax
of half-a-crown to the acre for his whole farm.&nbsp; There is no earthly
reason why agricultural laborers in this country should spend more in
drink than those of New England.&nbsp; I am confident that if a census
were taken of all the &ldquo;hired men&rdquo; of our six states, and
a fair average struck, the daily expenditure for drinks would not exceed
twopence, or four cents per head, while their average wages would amount
to 4s., or 96 cents, per day through the year.&nbsp; Yet our Summers
are far hotter and dryer than in England, our labor equally hard, and
there is really more natural occasion for drinks in our harvest fields
than here.&nbsp; It would require a severe apprenticeship for our men
to acquire a taste for sharp ale or strong beer as a beverage under
our July sun.&nbsp; A pail or jug of sweetened water, perhaps with a
few drops of cider to the pint, to sour it slightly, and a spoonful
of ginger stirred in, is our substitute for malt liquor.&nbsp; Sometimes
beer made of nothing but hops, water, and a little molasses, is brought
into the field, and makes even an exhilarating drink, without any alcoholic
effect.&nbsp; Cold coffee, diluted with water, and re-sweetened, is
a healthful and grateful luxury to our farm laborers.</p>
<p>It would be a blessed thing for all the outdoor and indoor laborers
in this country, if the broad chasm between the strong beer of Old England
and the small beer of New England could be bridged, and they be carried
across to the shore of a better habit.&nbsp; The farm hands here need
a good deal of gentle leading and suggestion in this matter.&nbsp; If
some humane and ingenious man would get up a new, cheap, cold drink,
which should be nutritious, palatable and exhilarating, without any
inebriating property, it would be a boon of immeasurable value.&nbsp;
Malt liquors are made in such rivers here, or rather in such lakes with
river outlets; there is such a system for their distribution and circulation
through every town, village, and hamlet; and they are so temptingly
and conveniently kegged, bottled, and jugged, and so handy to be carried
out into the field, that the habit of drinking them is almost forced
upon the poor man&rsquo;s lips.&nbsp; If a cheaper drink, refreshing
and strengthening, could be made equally convenient and attractive,
it would greatly help to break this hereditary thraldom to the Beer-Barrel.&nbsp;
Another powerful auxiliary to this good work might be contributed in
the form of a simple contrivance, which any man of mechanical genius
and a kind heart might elaborate.&nbsp; In this go-ahead age, scores
of things are made portable that once were fast-anchored solidities.&nbsp;
We have portable houses, portable beds, portable stoves and cooking
ranges, as well as portable steam-engines.&nbsp; Now, if some benevolent
and ingenious man would get up a little portable affair, at the cost
of two or three shillings, especially for agricultural laborers in this
country, which they could carry with one hand into the field, and by
which they could make and keep hot a pot of coffee, cocoa, chocolate,
broth or porridge, and also bake a piece of meat and a few potatoes,
it would be a real benefaction to thousands, and help them up to the
high road of a better condition.</p>
<p>What is the best condition to which the agricultural laborers in
Great Britain may ever expect to attain, or to which they may be raised
by that benevolent effort now put forth for their elevation?&nbsp; They
may all be taught to read and write and do a little in the first three
rules of arithmetic.&nbsp; That will raise them to a new status and
condition.&nbsp; Education of the masses has become such a vigorous
idea with the Government and people of England; so much is doing to
make the children of the manufacturing districts pass through the school-room
into the factory, carrying with them the ability and taste for reading;
ragged schools, working-men&rsquo;s clubs, and institutions for all
kinds of cheap learning and gratuitous teaching are multiplying so rapidly;
the press is turning out such a world of literature for the homes of
the poor, and the English Post, like a beneficent Providence, is distilling
such a morning dew of manuscript and printed thoughts over the whole
length and breadth of the country, and all these streams of elevating
influence are now so tending towards the agricultural laborers, that
there is good reason to believe the next generation of them will stand
head and shoulders above any preceding one in the stature of intelligence
and self-respect.&nbsp; This in itself will give them a new status in
society, as beneficial to their employers as to themselves.&nbsp; It
will increase their mutual respect, and create a better footing for
their relationships.</p>
<p>But the first improvement demanded in their condition, and the most
pressingly urgent, is a more comfortable, decent and healthy housing.&nbsp;
Until this is effected, all other efforts to raise them mentally and
morally must fail of their expected result.&nbsp; The <i>London Times</i>,
and other metropolitan, and many local, journals publish almost daily
distressing accounts of the miserable tenements occupied by the men
and women whose labor makes England the garden of fertility and beauty
that it is.&nbsp; Editors are making the subject the theme of able and
stirring articles, and some of the most eloquent members of Parliament
are speaking of it with great power.&nbsp; It is not only generous but
just to take the language in which the writers and orators of a country
denounce the evils existing in it <i>cum grano salis</i>, or with considerable
allowance for exaggeration.&nbsp; Their statements and denunciations
should not be used against their country as a reproach by the people
of another, because they prove an earnest desire and effort to reform
abuses which grew up in an unenlightened past.&nbsp; As a specimen of
the language which is sometimes held on this subject, I subjoin the
following paragraph from the <i>Saturday Review</i>, perhaps the most
cynical or unsentimental journal in England:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a wailing for the dirt and vice and misery which
must prevail in houses where seven or eight persons, of both sexes and
all ages, are penned up together for the night in the one rickety, foul,
vermin-hunted bed-room.&nbsp; The picture of agricultural life unrolls
itself before us as it is painted by those who know it best.&nbsp; We
see the dull, clouded mind, the bovine gaze, the brutality and recklessness,
and the simple audacity, and the confessed hatred of his betters, which
mark the English peasant, unless some happy fortune has saved him from
the general lot, and persuaded him that life has something besides beer
that the poor man may have and may relish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now this is a sad picture truly.&nbsp; The pen is sharp and cuts
like a knife,&mdash;but it is the surgeon&rsquo;s knife, not the poisoned
barb of a foreigner&rsquo;s taunt.&nbsp; This is the hopeful and promising
aspect of these delineations and denunciations of the laboring man&rsquo;s
condition.&nbsp; That low, damp, ill-ventilated, contracted room in
which he pens his family at night, was, quite likely, constructed in
the days of Good Queen Bess, or when &ldquo;George the Third was King,&rdquo;
at the latest.&nbsp; And houses were built for good, substantial farmers
in those days which they would hardly house their horses in now.&nbsp;
There are hundreds of mechanics and day-laborers in Edinburgh who pen
their families nightly in apartments once owned and occupied by Scotch
dukes and earls, but which a journeyman shoemaker of New England would
be loth to live in rent free.&nbsp; Even the favorite room of Queen
Mary, in Holyrood Palace, in which she was wont to tea and talk with
Rizzio, would be too small and dim for the shop-parlor of a small London
tradesman of the present day.&nbsp; Thus, after all, the low-jointed,
low-floored, small-windowed, ill-ventilated cottages now occupied by
the agricultural laborers of England were proportionately as good as
the houses built at the same period for the farmers of the country,
many of which are occupied by farmers now, and the like of which never
could be erected again on this island.&nbsp; Indeed, one wonders at
finding so many of these old farm houses still inhabited by well-to-do
people, who could well afford to live in better buildings.</p>
<p>This, then, is a hopeful sign, and both pledge and proof of progress&mdash;that
the very cottages of laboring men in England that once figured so poetically
in the histories and pictures of rural life, are now being turned inside
out to the scrutiny of a more enlightened and benevolent age, revealing
conditions that stir up the whole community to painful sensibility and
to vigorous efforts to improve them.&nbsp; These cottages were just
as low, damp, small and dirty thirty years ago as they are now, and
the families &ldquo;penned&rdquo; in them at night were doubtless as
large, and perhaps more ignorant than those which inhabit them at the
present time.&nbsp; It is not the real difference between the actual
conditions of the two periods but the difference in the dispositions
and perceptions of the public mind, that has produced these humane sensibilities
and efforts for the elevation of the ploughers, sowers, reapers and
mowers who enrich and beautify this favored land with their patient
and poorly-paid labor.&nbsp; And there is no doubt that these newly-awakened
sentiments and benevolent activities will carry the day; replacing the
present tenements of the agricultural laborers with comfortable, well-built
cottages, fitted for the homes of intelligent and virtuous families.&nbsp;
This work has commenced in different sections under favorable auspices.&nbsp;
Buildings have been erected on an estate here and there which will be
likely to serve as models for whole hamlets of new tenements.&nbsp;
From what I have heard, I should think that Lord Overstone, of the great
banking house of the Lloyds, has produced the best models for cottage
homes, on his estates in Northamptonshire.&nbsp; Although built after
the most modern and improved plan, and capacious enough to accommodate
a considerable family very comfortably, almost elegantly, the yearly
rent is only &pound;3, or less than <i>fifteen dollars</i>!</p>
<p>Now with a three-pound cottage, having a parlor, kitchen, bed-room
and buttery on the lower floor, and an equal number of apartments on
the upper; with a forty-rod garden to grow his vegetables, and with
a free school for his children at easy walking distance, the agricultural
laborer in England will be placed as far forward on the road of improvement
as the Government or people, or both, can set him.&nbsp; The rest of
the way upward and onward he must make by his own industry, virtue and
economy.&nbsp; From this point he must work out his own progress and
elevation.&nbsp; No Government, nor any benevolent association, nor
general nor private benevolence, can regulate the rate of his wages.&nbsp;
The labor market will determine that, just as the Corn Exchange does
the price of wheat.&nbsp; But there is one thing he can do to raise
himself in civil stature, moral growth, and domestic comfort.&nbsp;
He may empty the Jug into the Basket.&nbsp; He and his family may consume
in solids what they now do in frothy fluids.&nbsp; They may exchange
their scanty dinner of cold bacon and bread for one of roast beef and
plum pudding, by substituting cold coffee, cocoa or pure water for strong
beer.&nbsp; Or, if they are content to go on with their old fare of
food, they may save the money they expended in ale for the rent of one
or two acres of land, for a cow, or for two or three pigs, or deposit
it weekly in the Post-Office Savings&rsquo; Bank, until it shall amount
to a sum sufficient to enable them to set up a little independent business
of their own.</p>
<p>Here, then, are three great steps indispensable for the elevation
of the agricultural laborers of Great Britain to the highest level in
society which they can reach and maintain.&nbsp; Two of these the Government,
or the land-owners, or both, must take.&nbsp; They are Improved Dwellings
and Free and Accessible Education.&nbsp; These the laborer cannot provide
for himself and family.&nbsp; It is utterly beyond his ability to do
it.&nbsp; The third, last, long step must depend entirely upon himself;
though he may be helped on by sympathy, suggestion, and encouragement
from those who know how hard a thing it is for the fixed appetites to
break through the meshes of habit.&nbsp; He must make drink the cheapest
of human necessities.&nbsp; He must exchange Beer for Bread, for clothes,
for books, or for things that give permanent comfort and enjoyment.&nbsp;
When these three steps are accomplished, the British laborer will stand
before his country in the best position it can give him.&nbsp; And I
believe it will be a position which will make him contented and happy,
and be satisfactory to all classes of the people.</p>
<p>After all that can be done for them, the wages of the agricultural
laborers of Great Britain cannot be expected to exceed, on an average,
twelve shillings a week, or about half the price of the same labor in
America.&nbsp; Their rent and clothes cost them, perhaps, less than
half the sum paid by our farm hands for the same items of expenditure.&nbsp;
Their food must also cost only about half of what our men pay, who would
think they were poor indeed if they could not have hot meat breakfasts,
roast or boiled beef dinners and cold meat suppers, with the usual sprinkling
of puddings, pies, and cakes, and tea sweetened with loaf sugar.&nbsp;
Thus, after all, put the English laborer in the position suggested;
give him such a three-pound cottage and garden as Lord Overstone provides;
give his children free and convenient schooling; then let him exchange
his ale for nutritious and almost costless drinks, and if he is still
able to live for a few years on his old food-fare, he may work his way
up to a very comfortable condition with his twelve shillings a week,
besides his beer-money.&nbsp; On these conditions he would be able almost
to run neck and neck with our hired men in the matter of saving money
&ldquo;for a rainy day,&rdquo; or for raising himself to a higher position.</p>
<p>We will put them side by side, after the suggested improvements have
been realised; assuming each has a wife, with two children too young
to earn anything at field work.</p>

<p>I think the American reader, who is personally acquainted with the
habits and domestic economy of our farm laborers, will regard this estimate
of their expenditures as quite moderate.&nbsp; I have assumed, in both
cases, that no time is lost in the week on account of sickness, or of
weather, or lack of employment; and all the incidental expenses I have
included in the four general items given.&nbsp; It must also be conceded
that our farm hands do not average more than twenty-four English shillings,
or $5 75c., per week, through all the seasons of the year.&nbsp; The
amount of expenditure allowed in the foregoing estimate enables them
to support themselves and their families comfortably, if they are temperate
and industrious; to clothe and educate their children; to make bright
and pleasant homes, with well-spread tables, and to have respectable
seats in church on the Sabbath.&nbsp; On the other hand, we have assigned
to the English agricultural laborer what he would regard a proportionately
comfortable allowance for the wants of a week.&nbsp; We may not have
divided it correctly, but the total of the items is as great as he would
expect to expend on the current necessities of seven days.&nbsp; I doubt
if one in a thousand of the farm laborers of Great Britain lays out
more than the sum we have allotted for one week&rsquo;s food, rent,
and fuel and clothes.&nbsp; We then reach this result of the balance-sheet
of the two men.&nbsp; Their weekly savings hardly differ by a penny;
each amounting to about 5d., or 10 cents.&nbsp; At first sight, it might
seem, from this result, that the English farm laborer earns half as
much, lives half as well, and saves as much as the American.&nbsp; But
he has a resource for increasing his weekly savings which his American
competitor would work his fingers to the bone before he would employ.&nbsp;
His wife is able and willing to go with him into the field and earn
from three to five shillings a week.&nbsp; Then, if he commutes with
his employer, he will receive from him 4d. daily, or 2s. a week, for
beer-money.&nbsp; Thus, if he and his wife are willing to live, as such
families do now, on bread, bacon and cheese, and such vegetables as
they can grow in their garden, they may lay up, from their joint earnings,
a dollar, or four shillings a week, provided a sufficiently stimulating
object be set before them.&nbsp; To me it is surprising that they sustain
so much human life on such small means.&nbsp; They are often reproached
for their want of wise economy; but never was more keen ingenuity, more
close balancing of pennies against provisions than a great many of them
practice and teach.&nbsp; Let the most astute or utilitarian of social
economists try the experiment of housing, feeding and clothing himself,
wife and six children too young to earn anything, on ten or twelve shillings
a week; and he will learn something that his philosophy never dreamed
of.</p>
<p>Even while bending under the weight of the beer-barrel, thousands
of agricultural laborers in England have accomplished wonders by their
indefatigable industry, integrity and economy.&nbsp; Put a future before
them with a sun in it&mdash;some object they may reach that is worth
a life&rsquo;s effort, and as large a proportion of them will work for
it as you will find in any other country.&nbsp; A servant girl told
me recently that her father was a Devonshire laborer, who worked the
best years of his life for seven shillings a week, and her mother for
three, when they had half a dozen children to feed and clothe.&nbsp;
Yet, by that unflagging industry and ingenious economy with which thousands
wrestle with the necessities of such a life and throw them, too, they
put saving to saving, until they were able to rent an acre of orcharding,
a large garden for vegetables, then buy a donkey and cart, then a pony
and cart, and load and drive them both to market with their own and
their neighbors&rsquo; produce, starting from home at two in the morning.&nbsp;
In a few years they were able to open a little grocery and provision
shop, and are now taking their rank among the tradespeople of the village.&nbsp;
But if the farm servants of England could only be induced to give up
beer and lay by the money paid them as a substitute, it alone would
raise them to a new condition of comfort, even independence.&nbsp; At
4d. a day commutation money, they would have each &pound;5 at the end
of the year.&nbsp; That would pay the rent of two acres of land here;
or it would buy five on the Illinois Central Railroad.&nbsp; Three years&rsquo;
beer-money would pay for those rich prairie acres, his fare by sea and
land to them, and leave him &pound;3 in his pocket to begin their cultivation
with.&nbsp; Three years of this saving would make almost a new man of
him at home, in the way of self-respect, comfort and progress.&nbsp;
It would be a &ldquo;nest-egg,&rdquo; to which hope, habit and a strengthening
ambition would add others of larger size and value from year to year.</p>
<p>Give, then, the British agricultural laborer good, healthy Housing,
Free Schooling, and let him empty the Jug into the Basket, and he may
work his way up to a very comfortable condition at home.&nbsp; But if
he should prefer to go to Australia or America, where land is cheap
and labor dear, in a few years he may save enough to take him to either
continent, with sufficient left in his pocket to begin life in a new
world.</p>

HOUSE: THE PARK, AVENUES, ELMS, AND OAKS&mdash;THOUGHTS ON TREES, ENGLISH
AND AMERICAN.</i></p>
<p>Having now pursued a westerly direction until I was in the range
of a continuous upland section of country, I took a northward course
and walked on to Oundle, a goodly town in Northamptonshire, as unique
as its name.&nbsp; On the way, in crossing over to another turnpike
road, I passed through a large tract of land in a very <i>deshabille</i>
condition, rough, boggy and bushy.&nbsp; I soon found it was a game-growing
estate, and very productive of all sorts of birds and small quadrupeds.&nbsp;
The fields I crossed showed a promising crop of hares and rabbits; and
doubtless there were more partridges on that square mile than in the
whole State of Connecticut.&nbsp; This is a characteristic of the country
which will strike an American, at his first visit, with wonder.&nbsp;
He will see hares and rabbits bobbing about on common farms, and partridges
in broods, like separate flocks of hens and chickens, in fields of grain,
within a stone&rsquo;s throw of the farmer&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; I doubt
if any county in New England produces so many in a year as the holding
of Mr. Samuel Jonas already described.&nbsp; Rabbits have been put out
of the pale of protection somewhat recently, I believe, and branded
with the bad name of <i>vermin</i>; so that the tenant farmer may kill
them on his occupation without leave or license from the landlord.&nbsp;
It may indicate their number to state the fact, that one hundred and
twenty-five head of them were killed in one day&rsquo;s shooting on
Mr. Jonas&rsquo;s estate by his sons and some of their friends.</p>
<p>It was market day in Oundle, and I had the pleasure of sitting down
to dinner with a large company of farmers and cattle and corn-dealers.&nbsp;
They were intelligent, substantial-looking men, with no occupational
peculiarity of dress or language to distinguish them from ordinary middle-class
gentlemen engaged in trade or manufacture.&nbsp; Indeed, the old-fashioned
English farmer, of the great, round, purply-red face, aldermanic stature,
and costume of fifty years ago, speaking the dialect of his county with
such inimitable accent, is fast going out.&nbsp; I have not seen one
during my present sojourn in England.&nbsp; I fear he has disappeared
altogether with the old stage-coach, and that we have not pictures enough
of him left to give the rising generation any correct notion of what
he was, and how he looked.&nbsp; It may be a proper and utilitarian
change, but one can hardly notice without regret what transformations
the railway <i>regime</i> has wrought in customs and habits which once
individualised a country and people.&nbsp; A kind of French centralisation
in the world of fashion has been established, which has over-ridden
and obliterated all the dress boundaries of civilised nations.&nbsp;
All the upper and middle classes of Christendom centre themselves to
one focus of taste and merge into one plastic commonwealth, to be shaped
and moulded virtually by a common tailor.&nbsp; Their coats, vests,
pantaloons, boots and shoes are made substantially after the same pattern.&nbsp;
For a while, hats stood out with some show of pluck and patriotism,
and made a stand for national individuality, but it was in vain.&nbsp;
They, too, succumbed to the inexorable law of Uniformity.&nbsp; That
law was liberal in one respect.&nbsp; It did not insist that the stove-pipe
form should rule inflexibly.&nbsp; It admitted several variations, including
wide-awakes, pliable felts, and that little, squat, lackadaisical, round-crown,
narrow-brimmed thing worn by the Prince of Wales in the photographs
taken of him and the Princess at Sandringham.&nbsp; But this has come
to be the rule: that hats shall no longer represent distinct nationalities;
that they shall be interchangeable in all civilised communities; in
a word, that neither Englishman, American, French nor German shall be
known by his hat, whatever be the form or material of its body or brim.&nbsp;
If there were a southern county in England where the mercury stood at
100 degrees in the shade for two or three summer months, the upper classes
in it would don, without any hesitation, the wide, flappy broadbrims
of California, and still be in the fashion,&mdash;that is, variety in
uniformity.&nbsp; The peasantry, or the lowest laboring classes of European
countries, are now, and will remain perhaps for a century to come, the
only conservators of the distinctive national costumes of bygone generations.</p>
<p>During the conversation at the table, a farmer exhibited a head of
the Hallett wheat, which he had grown on his land.&nbsp; I never saw
anything to equal it, in any country in which I have travelled.&nbsp;
It was nearly six inches in length, and seeded large and plump from
top to bottom.&nbsp; This is a variety produced by Mr. Hallett, of Brighton,
and is creating no little interest among English grain-growers.&nbsp;
Lord Burghley, who had tested its properties, thus describes it, in
a speech before the Northamptonshire Agricultural Society last summer:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the Battersea Show last year, my attention was called to
some enormous ears of wheat, which I thought could not have been grown
in England.&nbsp; For, although the British farmer can grow corn with
anyone, I had never seen such wheat here, and thought it must be foreign
wheat.&nbsp; I went to the person who was threshing some out, and having
been informed that it was sown only with one seed in a hole, I procured
some of Mr. Hallett, of Brighton; and, being anxious to try the system,
I planted it according to Mr. Hallett&rsquo;s directions&mdash;one grain
in a hole, the holes nine and a half inches apart, with six inches between
the rows.&nbsp; To satisfy myself on the subject, I also planted some
according to Stephen&rsquo;s instructions, who said three grains in
a hole would produce the most profitable return.&nbsp; I also planted
some two grains in a hole.&nbsp; I sowed the grain at the end of last
September, on bad land, over an old quarry, and except some stiff clay
at the bottom of it, there was nothing in it good for wheat.&nbsp; The
other day I counted the stalks of all three.&nbsp; On Mr. Stephen&rsquo;s
plan of three grains in a hole, there were eighteen stalks; with two
grains in a hole, there was about the same number; but with one seed
in a hole, the lowest number of stalks was sixteen, and the highest
twenty-two.&nbsp; I planted only about half an acre as a trial, and
when I left home a few days since, it looked as much like eight quarters
(sixty-four bushels) to the acre as any I have seen.&nbsp; The ears
are something enormous.&nbsp; I would certainly recommend every farmer
to make his own experiments, for if it succeeds, it will prove a great
economy of seed; and drills to distribute it fairly are to be had.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Truly one of Hallett&rsquo;s wheat ears might displace the old <i>cornucopia</i>
in that picture of happy abundance so familiar to old and young.&nbsp;
Here are twenty ears from one seed, containing probably a thousand grains.&nbsp;
The increase of a thousand-fold, or half that ratio, is prodigious,
having nothing to equal it in the vegetable world that we know of.&nbsp;
If one bushel of seed wheat could be so distributed by a drill as to
produce 500 or 250 bushels at the harvest, certainly the staff of life
would be greatly cheapened to the millions who lean upon it alone for
subsistence.</p>
<p>From Oundle I walked the next day to Stamford, a good, solid, old
English town, sitting on the corners of three counties, and on three
layers of history, Saxon, Dane and Norman.&nbsp; The first object of
interest was a stone bridge over the Nen at Oundle.&nbsp; It is a grand
structure to span such a little river.&nbsp; It must have cost three
times as much as &ldquo;The Great Bridge&rdquo; over the Connecticut
at Hartford; and yet the stream it crosses is a mere rivulet compared
with our New England river.&nbsp; &ldquo;The bridge with wooden piers&rdquo;
is a fabric of fancy to most English people.&nbsp; They have read of
such a thing in Longfellow&rsquo;s poems, but hardly realise that it
exists still in civilised countries.&nbsp; Here bridges are works of
art as well as of utility, and rank next to the grand old cathedrals
and parish churches for solidity and symmetry.&nbsp; Their stone arches
are frequently turned with a grace as fine as any in St. Paul&rsquo;s,
and their balustrades and butments often approach the domain of sculpture.</p>
<p>Crossing the Nen, I followed it for several miles in a northerly
direction.&nbsp; I soon came to a rather low, level section of the road,
and noticed stones placed at the side of it, at narrow intervals, for
a long distance to the very foot of a village situated on a rising ground.&nbsp;
These stones were evidently taken from some ancient edifice, for many
of them bore the marks of the old cathedral or castle chisel.&nbsp;
They were the foot-tracks of a ruined monument of dark and painful history.&nbsp;
More than this might be said of them.&nbsp; They were the blood-drops
of a monstrosity chased from its den and hunted down by the people,
who shuddered with horror at its sanguinary record of violence and wrong.&nbsp;
As I approached the quiet village, whose pleasant-faced houses, great
and small, looked like a congregation of old and young sitting reverently
around the parish church and listening to the preaching of the belfry,
I saw where these stones came from.&nbsp; There, on that green, ridgy
slope, where the lambs lay in the sun by the river, these stones, and
a million more scattered hither and thither, once stood in walls high,
hideous and wrathful, for half a dozen centuries and more.&nbsp; If
the breathings of human woe, if the midnight misery of wretched, broken
hearts, could have penetrated these stones, one might almost fancy that
they would have sweat with human histories in the ditch where they lay,
and discolored the puddles they bridged with the bitter distilment of
grief centuries old.&nbsp; On that gentle rising from the little Nen
stood Fotheringay Castle.&nbsp; That central depression among the soft-carpeted
ridges marks the site of the <i>donjon</i> huge and horrid, where many
a knight and lady of noble blood was pinioned or penned in darkness
and hopeless duress centuries before the unfortunate Mary was born.&nbsp;
There nearly half the sad years of her young life and beauty were prisoned.&nbsp;
There she pined in the sickness of hope deferred, in the corroding anguish
of dread uncertainty, for a space as wide as that between the baptismal
font and presentation at Elizabeth&rsquo;s court.&nbsp; There she laid
her white neck upon the block.&nbsp; There fell the broad axe of Elizabeth&rsquo;s
envy, fear and hate.&nbsp; There fell the fair-haired head that once
gilded a crown and wore all the glory of regal courts&mdash;still beautiful
in the setting light of farewell thoughts.</p>
<p>It may be truly said of Fotheringay Castle, that not one stone is
left upon another to mark its foundations.&nbsp; Not Fleet-street Prison,
nor the Bastille itself, went out under a heavier weight of popular
odium.&nbsp; Although public sentiment, as well as the personal taste
and interest of their proprietors, has favored the preservation of the
ruins of old castles and abbeys in Great Britain, Fotheringay bore,
branded deep in its forehead, the mark of Cain, and every man&rsquo;s
hand, of the last generation, seemed to have been turned against it.&nbsp;
It has not only been demolished, but the <i>debris</i> have been scattered
far and wide, and devoted to uses which they scarcely honor.&nbsp; You
will see the well-faced stones for miles around, in garden walls, pavements,
cottage hearths and chimneys, in stables and cow-houses.&nbsp; In Oundle,
the principal hotel, a large castellated building, shows its whole front
built of them.</p>
<p>The great lion of Stamford is the Burghley House, the palace of the
Marquis of Exeter.&nbsp; It may be called so without exaggeration of
its magnificence as a building or of the extent and grandeur of its
surroundings.&nbsp; The edifice itself would cut up into nearly half
a dozen &ldquo;White Houses,&rdquo; such as we install our American
Presidents in at Washington.&nbsp; Certainly, in any point of view,
it is large and splendid enough for the residence of an emperor and
his <i>suite</i>.&nbsp; Its towers, turrets and spires present a picturesque
grove of architecture of different ages, and its windows, it is said,
equal in number all the days of the year.&nbsp; It was not open to the
public the day I was in Stamford, so I could only walk around it and
estimate its interior by its external grandeur.</p>
<p>But there was an outside world of architecture in the park of sublimer
features to me than even the great palace itself, with all its ornate
and elaborate sculpture.&nbsp; It was the architecture of the majestic
elms and oaks that stood in long ranks and folded their hands, high
up in the blue sky, above the finely-gravelled walks that radiated outward
in different directions.&nbsp; They all wore the angles and arches of
the Gothic order and the imperial belt of several centuries.&nbsp; I
walked down one long avenue and counted them on either side.&nbsp; There
were not sixty on both; yet their green and graceful roofage reached
a full third of a mile.&nbsp; Not sixty to pillar and turn such an arch
as that!&nbsp; I sat down on a seat at the end to think of it.&nbsp;
There was a morning service going on in this Cathedral of Nature.&nbsp;
The dew-moistened, foliated arches so lofty, so interwebbed with wavy,
waky spangles of sky, were all set to the music of the anthem.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The street musicians of the heavenly city&rdquo; were singing
one of its happiest hymns out of their mellow throats.&nbsp; The long
and lofty orchestra was full of them.&nbsp; Their twittering treble
shook the leaves with its breath, as it filtered down and flooded the
temple below.&nbsp; Beautiful is this building of God!&nbsp; Beautiful
and blessed are these morning singing-birds of His praise!&nbsp; Amen!</p>
<p>But do not go yet.&nbsp; No; I will not.&nbsp; Here is the only book
I carry with me on this walk&mdash;a Hebrew Psalter, stowed away in
my knapsack.&nbsp; I will open it here and now, and the first words
my eye lights upon shall be a text for a few thoughts on this scene
and scenery.&nbsp; And here they are,&mdash;seemingly not apposite to
this line of reflection, yet running parallel to it very closely:</p>
<p>[HEBREW PHRASE]</p>
<p>The best English that can be given of these words we have in our
translation: &ldquo;Blessed is he who, passing through the valley of
Baca, maketh it a well.&rdquo;&nbsp; Why so?&nbsp; On what ground?&nbsp;
If a man had settled down in that valley for life, there would have
been no merit in his making it a well.&nbsp; It might, in that case,
have been an act of lean-hearted selfishness on his part.&nbsp; Further
than this, a man might have done it who could have had the heart to
wall it in from the reach of thirsty travellers.&nbsp; No such man was
meant in the blessing; nor any man resident in or near the valley.&nbsp;
It was he who was &ldquo;passing through&rdquo; it, and who stopped,
not to search for a dribbling vein of water to satisfy his own momentary
thirst, but to make a well, broad and deep, after the oriental circumference,
at which all future travellers that way might drink with gladness.&nbsp;
That was the man on whom the blessing rested as a <i>condition</i>,
not as a <i>wish</i>.&nbsp; Look at the word, and get the right meaning
of it.&nbsp; It is [HEBREW WORD], not [HEBREW WORD]; it is a blessedness,
not a benediction.&nbsp; It means a permanent reality of happiness,
like that of Obededom, not a cheap &ldquo;I thank you!&rdquo; or &ldquo;the
Lord bless you!&rdquo; from here and there a man or woman who appreciates
the benefaction.</p>
<p>And he deserves the same who, &ldquo;passing through&rdquo; the short
years of man&rsquo;s life here on earth, plants trees like the living,
lofty columns of this long cathedral aisle.&nbsp; How unselfish and
generous is this gift to coming generations!&nbsp; How inestimable in
its value and surpassing the worth of wealth!&mdash;surpassing the measurement
of gold and silver!&nbsp; From my seat here, I look up to the magnificent
frontage of that baronial palace.&nbsp; I see its towers, turrets and
minarets; its grand and sculptured gateways and portals through this
long, leaf-arched aisle.&nbsp; Not forty, but nearer four hundred years,
doubtless, was that pile in building.&nbsp; Architecture of the pre-Norman
period, and of all subsequent or cognate orders, diversifies the tastes
and shapings of the structure.&nbsp; Suppose the whole should take fire
to-night and burn to the ground.&nbsp; The wealth of the owner could
command genius, skill and labor enough to rebuild it in three years,
perhaps in one.&nbsp; The Czar of all the Russias did as large a thing
once as this last, in the reconstruction of a palace.&nbsp; Perhaps
the building is insured for its positive value, and the insurance money
would erect a better one.&nbsp; But lift an axe upon that tall centurion
of these templed elms.&nbsp; Cut through the closely-grained rings that
register each succeeding year of two centuries.&nbsp; Hear the peculiar
sounding of the heart-strokes, when the lofty, well-poised structure
is balancing itself, and quivering through every fibre and leaf and
twig on the few unsevered tendons that have not yet felt the keen edge
of the woodman&rsquo;s steel.&nbsp; See the first leaning it cannot
recover.&nbsp; Hear the first cracking of the central vertebra; then
the mournful, moaning whir in the air; then the tremendous crash upon
the green earth; the vibration of the mighty trunk on the ground, like
the writhing and tremor of an ox struck by the butcher&rsquo;s axe;
the rebound into the air of dismembered branches; the frightened flight
of leaves and dust, and all the other distractions of that hour of death
and destruction.&nbsp; Look upon that ruin!&nbsp; The wealth, genius
and labor that could build a hundred Windsor Castles, and rebuild all
the cathedrals of England in a decade, could not rebuild in two centuries
that elm to the life and stature you levelled to the dust in two hours.</p>
<p>Put, then, the man who plants trees for posterity with him who, &ldquo;passing
through the valley of Baca, maketh it a well.&rdquo;&nbsp; Put him under
the same blessing of his kind, for he deserves it.&nbsp; He gives them
the richest earthly gift that a man can give to a coming generation.&nbsp;
In a practical sense, he gives them <i>time</i>.&nbsp; He gives them
a whole century, as an extra.&nbsp; If they would pay a gold sovereign
for every solid inch of oak, they could not hire one built to the stature
of one of these trees in less than two centuries&rsquo; time, though
they dug about it and nursed it as the man did the vine in Scripture.&nbsp;
Blessed be the builders of these living temples of Nature!&nbsp; Blessed
be the man, rich or poor, old or young, especially the old, who sets
his heart and hand to this cheap but sublime and priceless architecture.</p>
<p>Let connoisseurs who have seen Memphis, Nineveh, Athens, Rome, or
any or all of the great cities of the East, ancient or modern, come
and sit here, and look at this lofty corridor, and mark the orders and
graces of its architecture.&nbsp; What did the Ptolemies, their predecessors
or successors in Egypt, or sovereigns of Chaldaic names, in Assyria,
or ambitious builders in the ages of Pericles or Augustus, in Greece
or Rome?&nbsp; Their structures were the wonders of the world.&nbsp;
Mighty men they were, whose will was law, whose subjects worked it out
to its wildest impulse without a murmur or a reward.&nbsp; But who built
this sixty-columned temple, and bent these lofty arches?&nbsp; Two or
three centuries ago, two men in coarse garb, and, it may be, in wooden
shoes, came here with a donkey, bearing on its back a bundle of little
elms, each of a finger&rsquo;s girth.&nbsp; They came with the rude
pick and spade of that time; and, in the first six working hours of
the day, they dug thirty holes on this side of the aisle, and planted
in them half the tiny trees of their bundle.&nbsp; They then sat down
at noon to their bread and cheese and, most likely, a mug of ale, and
talked of small, home matters, just as if they were dibbling in a small
patch of wheat or potatoes.&nbsp; They then went to work again and planted
the other row; and, as the sun was going down, they straightened their
backs, and, with hands stayed upon their hips, looked up and down the
two lines and thought they would pass muster and please the master.&nbsp;
Then they shouldered their brightened tools and went home to their low,
dark cottages, discussing the prices of bread, beer and bacon, and whether
the likes of them could manage to keep a pig and make a little meat
in the year for themselves.</p>
<p>That is the story of this most magnificent structure to which you
look up with such admiration.&nbsp; Those two men in smock frocks, each
with a pocket full of bread and cheese, were the Michael Angelos of
this lofty St. Peter&rsquo;s.&nbsp; That donkey, with its worn panniers,
was the only witness and helper of their work.&nbsp; And it was the
work of a day!&nbsp; They may have been paid two English shillings for
it.&nbsp; The little trees may have cost two shillings more, if taken
from another estate.&nbsp; The donkey&rsquo;s day was worth sixpence.&nbsp;
O, wooden-shoed Ptolemies! what a day&rsquo;s work was that for the
world!&nbsp; They thought nothing of it&mdash;nothing more than they
would of transplanting sixty cabbages.&nbsp; They most likely did the
same thing the next day, and for most of the days of that year, and
of the next year, until all these undulating acres were planted with
trees of every kind that could grow in these latitudes.&nbsp; How cheap,
but priceless, is the gift of such trees to mankind!&nbsp; What a wealth,
what a glory of them can even a poor, laboring man give to a coming
generation!&nbsp; They are the most generous crops ever sown by human
hands.&nbsp; All others the sower reaps and garners into his own personal
enjoyment; but this yields its best harvest to those who come after
him.&nbsp; This is a seeding for posterity.&nbsp; From this well of
Baca shall they draw the cooling luxury of the gift when the hands that
made it shall have gone to dust.</p>
<p>And this is a good place and time to think of home&mdash;of what
we begin to hear called by her younger children, <i>Old</i> New England.&nbsp;
Trees with us have passed through the two periods specified by Solomon&mdash;&ldquo;a
time to plant and a time to pluck up.&rdquo;&nbsp; The last came first
and lasted for a century.&nbsp; Trees were the natural enemies to the
first settlers, and ranked in their estimation with the wild Indians,
wolves and bears.&nbsp; It was their first, great business to cut them
down, both great and small.&nbsp; Forests fell before the woodman&rsquo;s
axe.&nbsp; It made clean work, and seldom spared an oak or an elm.&nbsp;
But, at the end of a century, the people relented and felt their mistake.&nbsp;
Then commenced &ldquo;the time to plant;&rdquo; first in and around
cities like Boston, Hartford, and New Haven, then about villages and
private homesteads.&nbsp; Tree-planting for use and ornament marks and
measures the footsteps of our civilization.&nbsp; The present generation
is reaping a full reward of this gift to the next.&nbsp; Every village
now is coming to be embowered in this green legacy to the future; like
a young mother decorating a Christmas-tree for her children.&nbsp; Towns
two hundred years old are taking the names of this diversified architecture,
and they glory in the title.&nbsp; New Haven, with a college second
to none on the American Continent, loves to be called &ldquo;The Elm
City,&rdquo; before any other name.&nbsp; This generous and elevating
taste is making its way from ocean to ocean, even marking the sites
of towns and villages before they are built.&nbsp; I believe there is
an act of the Connecticut Legislature now in force, which allows every
farmer a certain sum of money for every tree he plants along the public
roadside of his fields.&nbsp; The object of this is to line all the
highways of the State with ornamental trees, so that each shall be a
well-shaded avenue.&nbsp; What a gift to another generation that simple
act is intended to make!&nbsp; What a world of wonder and delight will
our little State be to European travellers and tourists of the next
century, if this measure shall be carried out!&nbsp; If a few miles
of such avenues as Burghley Park and Chatsworth present, command such
admiration, what sentiments would a continuous avenue of trees of equal
size from Hartford to New Haven inspire!</p>
<p>While on this line of reflection, I will mention a case of monumental
tree-planting in New England, not very widely known there.&nbsp; A small
town, in the heart of Massachusetts, was stirred to the liveliest emotion,
with all the rest in her borders, by the Declaration of Independence
in 1776.&nbsp; Different communities expressed their sense of the importance
of this event in different ways, most of which were noisy and excited.&nbsp;
But the good people of this rural parish came together, and, at a happy
suggestion from some one of their number, agreed to spend the day in
planting trees to commemorate the momentous transaction.&nbsp; They
forthwith set to work, young and old, and planted first a double row
on each side of the walk from the main road up &ldquo;The Green&rdquo;
to their church door; then a row on each side of the public highway
passing through the village, for nearly a mile in each direction.&nbsp;
There was a blessed day&rsquo;s work for them, their children and children&rsquo;s
children.&nbsp; Every hand that wielded a spade, or held up a treelet
until its roots were covered with earth, has long since lost its cunning;
but the tall, green monuments they erected to the memory of the most
momentous day in American history, stand in unbroken ranks, the glory
of the village.</p>
<p>Although America will never equal England, probably, in compact and
picturesque &ldquo;plantations,&rdquo; or &ldquo;woods,&rdquo; covering
hundreds of acres, all planted by hand, our shade-trees will outnumber
hers, and surpass them in picturesque distribution and arrangement,
when our popular programme is fully carried out.&nbsp; In two or three
important particulars, we have a considerable advantage over this country
in respect to this tasteful embellishment.&nbsp; In the first place,
all the farmers in America own the lands they cultivate, and, on an
average, two sides of every farm front upon a public road.&nbsp; Two
or three days&rsquo; work suffices for planting a row of trees the whole
length of this frontage, or the roadside of the farmer&rsquo;s fence
or wall.&nbsp; This is being done more and more extensively from year
to year, generally under the influence of public taste and custom, and
sometimes under the stimulus of governmental compensation, as in Connecticut.&nbsp;
Thus, in the life of the present generation, all our main roads and
cross-roads may become arched and shaded avenues, giving the whole landscape
of the country an aspect which no other land will present.</p>
<p>Then we have another great advantage which England can never attain
until she learns how to consume her coal smoke.&nbsp; Our wood and anthracite
fires make no smoke to retard the growth or blacken the foliage of our
trees.&nbsp; Thus we may have them in standing armies, tall and green,
lining the streets, and overtopping the houses of our largest cities;
filtering with their wholesome leafage the air breathed by the people.&nbsp;
New Haven and Cleveland are good specimens of beautifully-shaded towns.</p>
<p>There is a third circumstance in our favor as yet, and of no little
value.&nbsp; The grand old English oak and elm are magnificent trees,
in park or hedge-row here.&nbsp; The horse-chestnut, lime, beech and
ash grow to a size that you will not see in America.&nbsp; The Spanish
chestnut, a larger and coarser tree than our American, reaches an enormous
girth and spread.&nbsp; The pines, larches and firs abound.&nbsp; Then
there are tree-hunters exploring all the continents, and bringing new
species from Japan and other antipodean countries.&nbsp; But as yet,
our maples have never been introduced; and without these the tree-world
of any country must ever lack a beautiful feature, both in spring, summer
and autumn, especially in the latter.&nbsp; Our autumnal scenery without
the maple, would be like the play of Hamlet with Hamlet left out; or
like a royal court without a queen.&nbsp; Few Americans, even loudest
in its praise, realise how much of the glory of our Indian summer landscape
is shed upon it by this single tree.&nbsp; At all the Flower Shows I
have seen in England and France, I have never beheld a bouquet so glorious
and beautiful as a little islet in a small pellucid lake in Maine, filled
to the brim, and rounded up like a full-blown rose, with firs, larches,
white birches and soft maples, with a little sprinkling of the sumach.&nbsp;
An early frost had touched the group with every tint of the rainbow,
and there it stood in the ruddy glow of the Indian summer, looking at
its face in the liquid mirror that smiled, still as glass, under its
feet.</p>
<p>I was much pleased to notice what honor was put upon one of our humble
and despised trees in Burghley House park, as in the grounds of other
noblemen.&nbsp; There was not one that spread such delicate and graceful
tresses on the breeze as our White Birch; not one that fanned it with
such a gentle, musical flutter of silver-lined leaves; not one that
wore a bodice of such virgin white from head to foot, or that showed
such long, tapering fingers against the sky.&nbsp; I was glad to see
such justice done to a tree in the noblest parks in England, which with
us has been treated with such disdain and contumely.&nbsp; When I saw
it here in such glory and honor, and thought how, notwithstanding its
Caucasian complexion, it is regarded as a nuisance in our woods, meadows
and pastures, so that any man who owns, or can borrow an axe, may cut
it down without leave or license wherever he finds it&mdash;when I saw
this disparity in its status in the two Englands, I resolved to plead
its cause in my own with new zeal and fidelity.</p>

<p><i>WALK TO OAKHAM&mdash;THE ENGLISH AND AMERICAN SPRING&mdash;THE
ENGLISH GENTRY&mdash;A SPECIMEN OF THE CLASS&mdash;MELTON MOWBRAY AND
ITS SPECIALITIES&mdash;BELVOIR VALE AND ITS BEAUTY&mdash;THOUGHTS ON
THE BLIND PAINTER.</i></p>
<p>From Stamford to Oakham was an afternoon walk which I greatly enjoyed.&nbsp;
This was the first week of harvest, and the first of August.&nbsp; How
wonderfully the seasons are localised and subdivided.&nbsp; How diversified
is the economy of light and heat!&nbsp; That field of wheat, thick,
tall and ripe for the sickle, was green and apparently growing through
all the months of last winter.&nbsp; What a phenomenon it would have
been, on the first of February last, to a New England farmer, suddenly
transported from his snow-buried hills to the view of this landscape
the same day!&nbsp; Not a spire of grass or grain was alive when he
left his own homestead.&nbsp; All was cold and dead.&nbsp; The very
earth was frozen to the solidity and sound of granite.&nbsp; It was
a relief to his eye to see the snow fall upon the scene and hide it
two feet deep for months.&nbsp; He looks upon this, then upon the one
he left behind.&nbsp; This looks full of luxuriant life, as green as
his in May.&nbsp; It has three months&rsquo; start of his dead and buried
crop.&nbsp; He walks across it; his shoes sink almost to the instep
in the soft soil.&nbsp; He sees birds hopping about in it without overcoats.&nbsp;
Surely, he says to himself, this is a favored land.&nbsp; Here it lies
on the latitudes of Labrador, and yet its midwinter fields are as green
as ours in the last month of Spring.&nbsp; At this rate the farmers
here must harvest their wheat before the ears of mine are formed.&nbsp;
But he counts without Nature.&nbsp; The American sun overtakes and distances
the English by a full month.&nbsp; Here is the compensation for six
consecutive months in which the New England farmer must house his plough
and not turn a furrow.</p>
<p>Doubtless, as much light and heat brighten and warm one country as
the other in the aggregate of a year.&nbsp; But there is a great difference
in the economy of distribution.&nbsp; In England, the sun spreads its
warmth more evenly over the four seasons of the year.&nbsp; What it
withholds from Summer it gives to Winter, and makes it wear the face
of Spring through its shortest and coldest days.&nbsp; But then Spring
loses a little from this equalising dispensation.&nbsp; It is not the
resurrection from death and the grave as it is in America.&nbsp; Children
are not waiting here at the sepulchre of the season, as with us, watching
and listening for its little <i>Bluebird</i> angel to warble from the
first budding tree top, &ldquo;<i>It is risen</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp; They
do not come running home with happy eyes, dancing for joy, and shouting
through the half open door, &ldquo;O, mother, Spring has come!&nbsp;
We&rsquo;ve heard the <i>Bluebird</i>!&nbsp; Hurrah!&nbsp; Spring has
come.&nbsp; We saw the <i>Phebee</i> on the top of the saw-mill!&rdquo;&nbsp;
Here Spring makes no sensation; takes no sudden leap into the seat of
Winter, but comes in gently, like the law of primogeniture or the British
Constitution.&nbsp; It is slow and decorous in its movements.&nbsp;
It is conservative, treats its predecessor with much deference, and
makes no sudden and radical changes in the face of things.&nbsp; It
comes in with no Lord Mayor&rsquo;s Day, and blows no trumpets, and
bends no triumphal arches to grace its <i>entree</i>.&nbsp; Few new
voices in the tree-tops hail its advent.&nbsp; No choirs of tree-toads
fiddle in the fens.&nbsp; No congregation of frogs at twilight gather
to the green edges of the unfettered pond to sing their Old Hundred,
led by venerable Signor Cronker, in his bright, buskin doublet, mounted
on a floating stump, and beating time with a bulrush.&nbsp; No <i>Shad-spirits</i>
with invisible wings, perform their undulating vespers in the heavens,
to let the fishermen know that it is time to look to their nets.&nbsp;
Even the hens of the farm-yard cackle with no new tone of hope and animation
at the birth of the English Spring.&nbsp; The fact is, it is a baby
three months old when it is baptised.&nbsp; It is really born at Christmas
instead of Easter, and makes no more stir in the family circle of the
seasons than any familiar face would at a farmer&rsquo;s table.</p>
<p>In a utilitarian point of view, it is certainly an immense advantage
to all classes in this country, that Nature has tempered her climates
to it in this kindly way.&nbsp; I will not run off upon that line of
reflection here, but will make it the subject of a few thoughts somewhere
this side of John O&rsquo;Groat&rsquo;s.&nbsp; But what England gains
over us in the practical, she loses in the poetical, in this economy
of the seasons.&nbsp; Her Spring does not thrill like a sudden revelation,
as with us.&nbsp; It does not come out like the new moon, hanging its
delicate silver crescent in the western pathway of the setting sun,
which everybody tries to see first over the right shoulder, for the
very luck of the coincidence.&nbsp; Still, both countries should be
contented and happy under this dispensation of Nature.&nbsp; The balance
is very satisfactory, and well suited to the character and habits of
the two peoples.&nbsp; The Americans are more radical and sensational
than the English; more given to sudden changes and stirring events.&nbsp;
Sterne generally gets the credit of saying that pretty thought first,
&ldquo;Providence tempers the wind to the shorn lamb.&rdquo;&nbsp; A
French writer puts it the other way, and more practically: &ldquo;Providence
tempers the wool of the lamb to the wind.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is far better
and more natural.&nbsp; But it may be truly said that Providence tempers
the seasons to the temperaments and customs of the two nations.</p>
<p>Just before reaching Oakham, I passed a grand mansion, standing far
back from the turnpike road, on a commanding eminence, flanked with
extensive plantations.&nbsp; The wide avenue leading to it looked a
full mile in length.&nbsp; Lawns and lakes, which mirrored the trees
with equal distinctness, suffused the landscape of the park like evening
smiles of Nature.&nbsp; It was indeed a goodly heritage for one man;
and he only mounted a plain <i>Mr</i>. to his name, although I learned
that he could count his farms by the dozen.&nbsp; I was told that the
annual dinner given to his tenant farmers came off the previous day
at the inn where I lodged.&nbsp; A sumptuous banquet was provided for
them, presided over by the steward of the estate; as the great <i>Mr</i>.
did not honor the plebeian company with his presence.&nbsp; This is
a feature of the structure of English society which the best read American
would not be likely to recognise without travelling somewhat extensively
in the country.&nbsp; The British Nobility, the great, world-renowned
Middle Class, and the poor laboring population, constitute the three
great divisions of the people and include them all in his mind.&nbsp;
He is apt to leave out of count the Gentry, the great untitled MISTERS,
who come in between the nobility and middle-men, and constitute the
connecting link between them.&nbsp; &ldquo;The fine old English gentleman,
all of the olden time,&rdquo; is supposed to belong to this class.&nbsp;
They make up most of &ldquo;the old county families,&rdquo; of which
you hear more than you read.&nbsp; They are generally large landholders,
owning from twenty to one hundred farms.&nbsp; They live in grand old
mansions, surrounded with liveried servants, and inspire a mild awe
and respectful admiration, not only in the common country people, but
in the minds of persons in whom an American would not look for such
homage to untitled rank.&nbsp; They hunt with horses and dogs over the
grounds of their tenant farmers, and the latter often act as game-beaters
for them at their &ldquo;shootings.&rdquo;&nbsp; When one of them owns
a whole village, church and all, he is generally called &ldquo;the Squire,&rdquo;
but most of them are squired without the definite article.&nbsp; They
still boast of as good specimens of &ldquo;the fine old English gentleman&rdquo;
as the country can show; and I am inclined to think it is not an unfounded
pretension, although I have not yet come in contact with many of the
class.</p>
<p>One of this county squirocracy I know personally and well,&mdash;and
other Americans know him as well as myself,&mdash;who, though living
in a palace of his own, once occupied by an exiled French sovereign,
is just as simple and honest as a child in every feature of his disposition
and deportment.&nbsp; Every year he has a Festival in his park, lasting
two or three days.&nbsp; It is a kind of out-door Parliament and a Greenwich
Fair combined, as it would seem at first sight to an incidental spectator.&nbsp;
I do not believe anything in the rest of the wide world could equal
this gathering, for many peculiar features of enjoyment.&nbsp; It is
made up of both sexes and all ages and conditions; especially of the
laboring classes.&nbsp; They come out strong on these occasions.&nbsp;
The round and red faced boys and girls of villages and hamlets for a
great distance around look forward to this annual frolic with exhilarating
expectation.&nbsp; Never was romping and racing and the amorous forfeit
plays of the ring got up under more favorable auspices, or with more
pleasant surroundings.&nbsp; It would do any man&rsquo;s heart good,
who was ever a genuine boy, to see the venerable squire and his lady
presiding over a race between competing couples of ploughmens&rsquo;
boys, from ten to fifteen years of age, running their rounds in the
park, bare-footed, bare-headed, with faces as round and red as a ripe
pumpkin, and hair of the same color whipping the air as they neck-and-neck
it in the middle of the heat.&nbsp; When the winners of the prizes receive
their rewards at his hands, his kind words and the radiant benevolence
of his face they value more than the conquest and the coins they win.</p>
<p>Then there are intellectual entertainments and deliberative proceedings
of grave moment arranged for the elder portion of the great congregation.&nbsp;
While groups of blushing lads and lasses are hunting the handkerchief
in the hustle and tussle of the ring under the great, solemn elms, a
scene may be witnessed on the lawn nearer the mansion that ought to
have been painted long ago.&nbsp; Two or three double-horse wagons are
ranged end to end in the shade, and planks are placed along from one
end to the other, making a continuous seat for a score or two of orators.&nbsp;
In front of this dozen-wheeled tribune rows of seats, capable of holding
several hundred persons, are arranged within hearing distance.&nbsp;
When these are filled and surrounded by a standing wall of men and women,
three or four deep, and when the orators of the day ascend over the
wheels to the long wagon-seat, you have a scene and an assembly the
like of which you find nowhere else in Christendom.&nbsp; No Saxon parliament
of the Heptarchy could &ldquo;hold a candle to it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Never,
in any age or country of free speech, did individual ideas, idiosyncrasies,
and liberty of conscience have freer scope and play.&nbsp; Never did
all the isms of philanthropy, politics, or of social and moral reform
generally have such a harmonious trysting time of it.&nbsp; Never was
there a platform erected for discussing things local and general so
catholic as the one now resting upon the wheels of those farm wagons.&nbsp;
Every year the bland and venerable host succeeds in widening the area
of debate.&nbsp; I was invited to be present at the Festival this year,
but was too far on the road to John O&rsquo;Groat&rsquo;s to participate
in a pleasure I have often enjoyed.&nbsp; But I read his <i>resume</i>
of the year&rsquo;s doings, aspects and prospects from Japan to Hudson&rsquo;s
Bay with lively interest and valuable instruction.&nbsp; He seldom presides
himself as chairman, but leaves that post of honor to be filled, if
possible, by the citizen of some foreign country, if he can speak English
tolerably.&nbsp; This gives a more cosmopolitan aspect to the assembly.&nbsp;
But he himself always makes what in Parliament would be called &ldquo;a
financial statement,&rdquo; without the reference to money matters.&nbsp;
He sums up the significance of all the great events of the year, bearing
upon human progress in general, and upon each specific enterprise in
particular.&nbsp; With palatial mansions, parks, and farms great and
small, scattered through several counties, he is the greatest radical
in England.&nbsp; He distances the Chartists altogether in his programme,
and adds several new points to their political creed.&nbsp; He not only
advocates manhood suffrage, but womanhood suffrage, and woman-seats
in Parliament.&nbsp; Then he is a great friend of a reform which the
Chartists grievously overlook, and which would make thousands of them
voters if they would adopt it.&nbsp; That is, Total Abstinence from
Tobacco, as well as from Ardent Spirits.&nbsp; Thus, no report of modern
times equals the good Squire&rsquo;s summing-up, which he gives on these
occasions, from the great farm-wagon tribune, to the multitudinous and
motley congregation assembled under his park trees.&nbsp; This year
it was unusually rich and piquant, from the expanded area of events
and aspects.&nbsp; In presenting these, as bearing upon the causes of
Temperance, Peace, Anti-War, Anti-Slavery, Anti-Tobacco, Anti-Capital
Punishment, Anti-Church-Rates, Free Trade, Woman&rsquo;s Rights, Parliamentary
Reform, Social Reform, Scientific Progress, Discovery of the Sources
of the Nile, and other important movements, he was necessarily obliged
to be somewhat discursive.&nbsp; But he generalised with much ease and
perspicuity, and conducted the thread of his discourse, like a rivulet
of light, through the histories of the year; transporting the mind of
his audience from doings in Japan to those in America, from Poland to
Mexico, and through stirring regions of Geography, Politics, Philanthropy,
Social Science and Economy, by gentle and interesting transitions.&nbsp;
This annual statement is very valuable and instructive, and should have
a wider publicity than it usually obtains.</p>
<p>When &ldquo;the fine old English gentleman all of the olden time&rdquo;
has concluded his <i>resume</i> of the year&rsquo;s progress, and the
prospects it leaves to the one incoming, the orators of the different
causes which he has thus reported, arise one after the other, and the
bright air and the green foliage of the over-spreading trees, as well
as the listening multitude below are stirred with fervid speeches, sometimes
interspersed with &ldquo;music from the band.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Festival
is wound up by a banquet in the hall, given by the munificent host to
a large number of guests, representing the various good movements advocated
from the platform described.&nbsp; Many Americans have spoken from that
rostrum, and sat at that banquet table in years gone by, and they will
attest to the correctness of these slight delineations of the character
of the host and of the annual festival that will perpetuate his name
in long and pleasant remembrance.</p>
<p>Oakham is a goodly and pleasant town, the chief and capital of Rutlandshire.&nbsp;
It has the ruins of an old castle in its midst, and several interesting
antiquities and customs.&nbsp; It, too, has its unique speciality or
prerogative.&nbsp; I was told that every person of title driving through
the town, or coming to reside within the jurisdiction of its bye-laws,
must leave his card to the authorities in the shape of a veritable <i>horse-shoe</i>.&nbsp;
It is said that the walls of the old town hall are hung with these iron
souvenirs of distinguished visits; thus constituting a museum that would
be instructive to a farrier or blacksmith, as well as to the antiquarian.</p>
<p>From Oakham I walked to Melton Mowbray, a cleanly, good-looking town
in Leicestershire, situated on the little river Eye.&nbsp; One cannot
say exactly in regard to Rutlandshire what an Englishman once said to
the authorities of a pigmy Italian duchy, who ordered him to leave it
in twenty-four hours.&nbsp; &ldquo;I only require fifteen minutes,&rdquo;
said cousin John, with a look and tone which Jonathan could not imitate.&nbsp;
This rural county is to the shire-family of England what Rhode Island
is to the American family of States&mdash;the smallest, but not least,
in several happy characteristics.</p>
<p>I spent a quiet Sabbath in Melton Mowbray; attended divine service
in the old parish church and listened to two extemporaneous sermons
full of simple and earnest teaching, and delivered in a conversational
tone of voice.&nbsp; Here, too, the parish church was seated in the
midst of the great congregation which had long ceased to listen to the
call of its Sabbath bells.&nbsp; It was a beautiful and touching arrangement
of the olden time to erect the House of Prayer in the centre of &ldquo;God&rsquo;s
Acre,&rdquo; that the shadow of its belfry and the Sabbath voice of
its silvery bells might float for centuries over the family circles
lying side by side in their long homes around the sanctuary.&nbsp; There
was a good and tender thought in making up this sabbath society of the
living and the dead; in planting the narrow pathway between the two
Sions with the white milestones of generations that had travelled it
in ages gone, leaving here and there words of faith, hope and admonition
to those following in their footsteps.&nbsp; It is one of the contingencies
of &ldquo;higher civilization&rdquo; that this social economy of the
churchyard, that linked present and past generations in such touching
and instructive companionship, has been suspended and annulled.</p>
<p>Melton Mowbray has also a very respectable individuality.&nbsp; It
is a great centre for the scarlet-coated Nimrods who scale hedges and
ditches, in well-mounted squadrons, after a fox <i>preserved</i> at
great expense and care to become the victim of their valor.&nbsp; But
this is a small and frivolous distinction compared with its celebrated
manufacture of <i>pork-pies</i>.&nbsp; It bids fair to become as famous
for them as Banbury is for buns.&nbsp; I visited the principal establishment
for providing the travelling and picnicking world with these very substantial
and palatable portables.&nbsp; I went under the impulse of that uneasy,
suspicious curiosity to peer into the forbidden mysteries of the kitchen
which generally brings no satisfaction when gratified, and which often
admonishes a man not only to eat what is set before him without any
questions for conscience sake, but also for the sake of the more delicate
and exacting sensibilities of the stomach.&nbsp; I must confess my first
visit to this, the greatest pork-pie factory in the world, savored a
little of the anxiety to know the worst, instead of the best, in regard
to the solid materials and lighter ingredients which entered into the
composition of these suspiciously cheap luxuries.&nbsp; There were points
also connected with the process of their elaboration which had given
me an undefinable uneasiness in the refreshment rooms of a hundred railway
stations.&nbsp; I was determined to settle these moot points once for
all.&nbsp; So I entered the establishment with an eye of as keen a speculation
as an exciseman&rsquo;s searching a building for illicit distillery,
and I came out of it a more charitable and contented man.&nbsp; All
was above board, fair and clean.&nbsp; The meat was fresh and good.&nbsp;
The flour was fine and sweet; the butter and lard would grace the neatest
housewife&rsquo;s larder; the forms on which the pies were moulded were
as pure as spotless marble.&nbsp; The men and boys looked healthy and
bright; their hands were smooth and clean, and their aprons white as
snow.&nbsp; Not one of them smoked or took snuff at his work.&nbsp;
I saw every process and implement employed in the construction of these
pies for the market; the great tubs of pepper and spice, the huge ovens,
the cooling racks, the packing room; in a word, every department and
feature of the establishment.&nbsp; And the best thing that I can say
of it is this: that I shall eat with better satisfaction and relish
hereafter the pies bearing the brand of Evans, of Melton Mowbray, than
I ever did before.&nbsp; The famous Stilton cheese is another speciality
of this quiet and interesting town, or of its immediate neighborhood.&nbsp;
So, putting the two articles of luxury and consumption together, it
is rather ahead of Banbury with its cakes.</p>
<p>On Monday, August 11th, I resumed my walk northward, and passed through
a very highly cultivated and interesting section.&nbsp; About the middle
of the afternoon, I reached Broughton Hill, and looked off upon the
most beautiful and magnificent landscape I have yet seen in England.&nbsp;
It was the Belvoir Vale; and it would be worth a hundred miles&rsquo;
walk to see it, if that was the only way to reach it.&nbsp; It lay in
a half-moon shape, the base line measuring apparently about twenty miles
in length.&nbsp; As I sat upon the high wall of this valley, that overlooks
it on the south, I felt that I was looking upon the most highly-finished
piece of pre-Raphaelite artistry that could be found in the world,&mdash;the
artistry of the plough, glorious and beautiful with the unconscious
and involuntary pictures which patient human labor paints upon the canvas
of Nature.&nbsp; Never did I see the like before.&nbsp; If Turner had
the shaping of the ground entirely for an artistic purpose, it could
not have been more happily formed for a display of agricultural pictures.&nbsp;
What might be called the <i>physical</i> vista made the most perfect
<i>hemiorama</i> I ever looked upon.&nbsp; The long, high, wooded ridge,
including Broughton Hill, <i>eclipsed</i>, as it were, just half the
disk of a circle twenty miles in diameter, leaving the other half in
all the glow and glory that Nature and that great blind painter, Agricultural
Industry, could give to it.&nbsp; The valley with its foot against this
mountainous ridge, put out its right arm and enfolded to its bosom a
little, beautiful world of its own of about fifty miles girth.&nbsp;
In this embrace were included hundreds of softly-rounded hills, with
their intervening valleys, villages, hamlets, church spires and towers,
plantations, groves, copses and hedge-row trees, grouped by sheer accident
as picturesquely as Turner himself could have arranged them.&nbsp; The
elevation of the ridge on which I sat softened down all these distant
hills, so that they looked only like little undulating risings by which
the valley gently ascended to the blue rim of the horizon on the north.</p>
<p>It was an excellent standpoint on which to balance Nature and Human
Industry; to estimate their separate and joint work upon that vast landscape.&nbsp;
A few centuries ago, perhaps about the time that the Mayflower sighted
Plymouth Rock, this valley, now so indescribably beautiful, was almost
in the state of nature.&nbsp; Wolves and wild boars may have been prowling
about in the woods and tangled thickets that covered this ridge back
for several leagues.&nbsp; Bushes, bogs and briers, and coarse prairie
grass roughened the bottom of this valley; matted heather, furze, broom
and clumps of shrubby trees, all those hills and uplands arising in
the background to the northward horizon.&nbsp; This declining sun, and
the moon and stars that will soon follow in the pathway of its chariot,
like a liveried <i>cortege</i>, shone upon that scene with all the light
they will give this day and night.&nbsp; The rain and dew, and all the
genial ministries of the seasons, did their unaided best to make it
lovely and beautiful.&nbsp; The sweetest singing-birds of England came
and tried to cheer its solitude with their happy voices.&nbsp; The summer
breezes came with their softest breath, whispering through brake, bush
and brier the little speeches of Nature&rsquo;s life.&nbsp; The summer
bees came and filled all those heather-purpled acres with their industrial
lays, and sang a merry song in the door of every wild-flower that gave
them the petalled honey of its heart.&nbsp; All the trained and travelling
industrials and all the sweet influences of Nature came and did all
they could without man&rsquo;s help to make this great valley most delightful
to the eye.&nbsp; But the wolves still prowled and howled; the briers
grew rough and rank; the grass, coarse and thin; the heathered hills
were oozy and cold in their watery beds; the clumpy, shrubby trees wore
the same ragged coats of moss; and no feature of the scene mended for
the better from year to year.</p>
<p>Then came the great Blind Painter, with his rude, iron pencils, to
the help of Nature.&nbsp; He came with the Axe, Plough and Spade, her
mightiest allies.&nbsp; With these he had driven wild Druidic Paganism
back mile by mile from England&rsquo;s centre; back into her dark fastnesses.&nbsp;
With the Axe, Spade and Plough he chased the foul beasts and barbarisms
from the island.&nbsp; Two centuries long was he in painting this Beautiful
Valley.&nbsp; Nature ground and mixed the colors for him all the while,
for he was blind.&nbsp; He was poor; often cold and hungry, and his
children, with blue fingers and pale, silent eyes, sometimes asked for
bread in winter he could not give.&nbsp; He lived in a low cottage,
small, damp and dark, and laid him down at night upon a bed of straw.&nbsp;
He could not read; and his thoughts of human life and its hereafter
were few and small.&nbsp; He had no taste for music, and seldom whistled
at his work.&nbsp; He wore a coarse garment, of ghostly pattern, called
a smock-frock.&nbsp; His hat just rounded his head to a more globular
and mindless form.&nbsp; His shoes were as heavy as a horse&rsquo;s
with iron nails.&nbsp; He had no eye nor taste for colors.&nbsp; If
all the trees, if all the crops of grain, grass and roots on which he
wrought his life long, had come out in brickdust and oil, it would have
been all the same to him, if they had sold as high in the market, and
beer and bread had been as cheap for the uniformity.&nbsp; And yet he
was the Turner of this great painting.&nbsp; He is the artist that has
made England a gallery of the finest agricultural pictures in the world.&nbsp;
And in no country in Christendom is High Art so appreciated to such
pecuniary patronage and valuation as here.&nbsp; In none is the genius
of the Pencil so treasured, so paid, and almost worshipped as here.&nbsp;
The public and private galleries of Britain hold pictures that would
buy every acre of the island at the price current of it when Elizabeth
was queen.&nbsp; One of Turner&rsquo;s landscapes would pay for a whole
Highland county at its valuation when Mary held her first court at Holyrood.</p>
<p>I sit here and look off upon this largest, loveliest picture the
Blind Painter has given to England.&nbsp; I note his grouping of the
ivy-framed fields, of every size and form, panelling the gently-rounded
hills, and all the soft slopes down to the foot of the valley; the silvery,
ripe barley against the dark-green beans; the rich gold of the wheat
against the smooth, blue-dashed leaves of the mangel wurzel or rutabaga;
the ripening oats overlooking a foreground of vividly green turnips,
with alternations of pasture and meadow land, hedges running in every
direction, plantations, groves, copses sprinkled over the whole vista,
as if the whole little world, clear up to the soft, blue fringe of the
horizon, were the design and work of a single artist.&nbsp; And this,
and ten thousand pictures of the same genius, were the work of the Briarean-handed
BLIND PAINTER, who still wears a smock-frock and hob-nailed shoes, and
lives in a low, damp cottage, and dines on bread and cheese among the
golden sheaves of harvest!</p>
<p>O, Mother England! thou that knightest the artists while living,
and buildest their sepulchres when dead; thou that honorest to such
stature of praise the plagiarists upon Nature, and clothest the copyists
of patient Labor&rsquo;s pictures in such purple and fine linen; thou
whose heart is softening to the sweet benevolences of Christian charity
in so many directions,&mdash;wilt thou not think, with a new sentiment
of kindness and sympathy, on this Blind Painter, who has tapestried
the hills and valleys of thy island with an artistry that angels might
look upon with admiration and wonder!</p>
<p>Wilt thou not build him a better cottage to live in?</p>
<p>Wilt thou not give him something better than dry bread and cold bacon
for dinner in harvest?</p>
<p>Wilt thou not teach all his children to read the alphabet and the
blessed syllables of the Great Revelation of God&rsquo;s Love to man?</p>
<p>Wilt thou not make a morning-ward door in his dwelling and show him
a future with a sun in it, in <i>this</i> world, as well as the world
to come?</p>
<p>Wilt thou not open up a pathway through the valley of his humiliation
by which his children may ascend to the better conditions of society?</p>

<p><i>NOTTINGHAM AND ITS CHARACTERISTICS&mdash;NEWSTEAD ABBEY&mdash;MANSFIELD&mdash;TALK
IN A BLACKSMITH&rsquo;S SHOP&mdash;CHESTERFIELD, CHATSWORTH AND HADDON
HALL&mdash;ARISTOCRATIC CIVILISATION, PRESENT AND PAST.</i></p>
<p>From the Belvoir Vale I continued my walk to Nottingham the following
day; crossing a grand old bridge over the Trent.&nbsp; Take it all in
all, this may be called perhaps the most English town in England; stirring,
plucky and radical; full of industrial intellect and vigor.&nbsp; Its
chief businesses involve and exercise thought; and thought educed into
one direction and activity, runs naturally into others.&nbsp; The whole
population, under these influences, has become <i>peopled</i> to a remarkable
status and strength of opinion, sentiment and action.&nbsp; They prefix
that large and generous quality to their best doings and institutions,
and have their Peoples&rsquo; College, Peoples&rsquo; Park, etc.&nbsp;
The Peoples&rsquo; Charter had its stronghold here, and all radical
reforms are sure to find sympathy and support among the People of Nottingham.&nbsp;
I should think no equal population in the kingdom would sing &ldquo;Britons
never, never will be slaves,&rdquo; with more spirit, or, perhaps, with
more understanding.&nbsp; Their plucky, English natures became terribly
stirred up in the exciting time of the Reform Bill, and they burned
down the magnificent palace-castle of the old Duke of Newcastle, crowning
the mountainous rock which terminates on the west the elevated ridge
on which the town is built.&nbsp; When the Bill was carried, and the
People had cooled down to their normal condition of mind, they were
obliged to pay for this evening&rsquo;s illumination of their wrath
pretty dearly.&nbsp; The Duke mulcted the town and county to the tune
of &pound;21,000, or full $100,000.&nbsp; The castle was no Chepstow
structure, rough and rude for war, but more like the ornate and castellated
palace at Heidelberg, and it was almost as high above the Trent as the
latter is above the Neckar.&nbsp; The view the site commands is truly
magnificent, embracing the Trent Valley, and an extensive vista beyond
it.&nbsp; It was really the great lion of the town, and the People,
having paid the &pound;21,000 for dismounting it, because it roared
in the wrong direction on the Reform Bill, expected, of course, that
His Grace the Duke would set it up again on the old pedestal, with its
mane and tail and general aspect much improved.&nbsp; But they counted
without their host.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is it not lawful to do what I will
with my own,&rdquo; was the substance of his reply; and there stands
the blackened, crumbling ruin to this day, as a silent but grim reproach
to the People for letting their angry passions rise to such destructive
excitement on political questions.</p>
<p>Hosiery and lace are the two great manufacturing interests of Nottingham,
and the tons of these articles it turns out yearly for the world are
astonishing in number and value.&nbsp; A single London house employs
3,000 hands in the town and immediate vicinity upon hosiery alone for
its establishment.&nbsp; Lace now seems to lead the way, and there are
whole streets of factories and warehouses busy with its manufacture
and sale.&nbsp; Perhaps no fabric in the world ever tested the ingenuity
and value of machinery like this.&nbsp; The cost has been reduced, from
the old hand-working to the present process, from three dollars to three
cents a yard!&nbsp; I think no machinery yet invented has been endowed
with more delicate functions of human reason and genius than that employed
upon the flower-work of this subtle drapery.&nbsp; Until I saw it with
my own eyes, I had concluded that the machinery invented or employed
in America for setting card-teeth was the most astute, and as nearly
approaching the faculties of the human mind in its apparent thought-power,
as it was reverent and safe to carry anything made of iron and steel,
or made by man at all.&nbsp; To construct a machine which should pass
between its fingers a broad belt of leather and a fine thread of wire,
prick rows of holes across the breadth of the leather, bend, cut off,
and insert the shank ends of the teeth clear through these holes, and
clinch them on the back side, and pour out a continuous, uninterrupted
stream of perfectly-teethed belt, all ready for carding,&mdash;this,
I fancied, was the <i>ne plus ultra</i> of mechanical inventions.&nbsp;
But it is quite surpassed by the lace-weaving looms of Nottingham, that
work out, to exquisite perfection, all the flowers, leaves, vines and
vein-work of nature.&nbsp; It was wonderful to see the ductility of
cotton, as here exemplified.&nbsp; The <i>bobbins</i>, which, I suppose,
are a mere refinement upon the old hand-thrown shuttle, are of brass,
about the size of half-a-crown.&nbsp; A groove that will just admit
the thin edge of a case-knife, is cut into the rim of the little wheel,
about one quarter of an inch deep.&nbsp; A cotton thread, 120 yards
in length, and strong enough to be twitched about and twisted by a score
of vigorous, chattering, iron fingers, is wound around in this groove.&nbsp;
But it would be idle to attempt a description of either the machinery
or the process.</p>
<p>I went next into a large establishment for dyeing, dressing, winding
and packing the lace for market.&nbsp; It was startling to see the acres
of it dyed black for mourning.&nbsp; Really there seemed enough of it
to drape the whole valley of the shadow of death!&nbsp; It was an impressive
sight truly.&nbsp; If there were other establishments doing the same
thing, Nottingham must turn out weeds of grief enough for several millions
of mourning widows, mothers, sisters and daughters in a year.&nbsp;
I ascended into the dressing-room, I think they called it, in the upper
story, where there was a piece containing one twenty-fifth of an acre
of lace undergoing a fearful operation for a human constitution to sustain.&nbsp;
It was necessary that the heat of the apartment should be kept at <i>one
hundred and twenty</i> degrees!&nbsp; There was a large number of women
and girls, and a few men and boys working under this melting ordeal.&nbsp;
And one of the proprietors was at their head, in a rather summer dress,
and with a seethed and crimson face beaded with hot perspiration.&nbsp;
It was a very delicate and important operation which he had not only
to watch with his own eyes, but to work at with his own hands.&nbsp;
I was glad to learn that he was a staunch Protestant, and did not believe
in <i>purgatory</i>; but those poor girls!&mdash;could they be expected
to hold to the same belief under such a test?</p>
<p>I was told that they could get up lace so cheap that the people of
the town frequently cover their gooseberry bushes with it to keep off
the insects.&nbsp; Spider-webbing is a scarcely more gossamer-like fabric.&nbsp;
Sixteen square yards of this lace only weigh about an ounce!&nbsp; If
the negroes on one of the South Carolina Sea-island plantations could
have been shut into that dressing-room for two whole minutes, with the
mercury at 120 degrees, they would have rolled up the whites of their
eyes in perfect amazement and made a rush for &ldquo;Dixie&rdquo; again.</p>
<p>From Nottingham I made an afternoon walk to Mansfield.&nbsp; The
weather was splendid and the country in all the glory of harvest.&nbsp;
On reaching Newstead Abbey, I found, to my regret, that the <i>entree</i>
to the public had been closed by the new proprietor, one, I was told,
of the manufacturing gentry of the Manchester school.&nbsp; Not that
he was less liberal and accommodating to sight-seers than his predecessors,
but because he was making very extensive and costly improvements in
the buildings and grounds.&nbsp; I have seen nothing yet in England
to compare, for ornate carving, with the new gate-way he is making to
the park.&nbsp; It is of the finest kind of arabesque work done in stone
that much resembles the Caen.&nbsp; This prevention barred me from even
a distant view of the once famous residence of Lord Byron, as it could
not be seen from the public road.</p>
<p>Within about three miles of Mansfield, I came to a turnpike gate,&mdash;a
neat, cozy, comfortable cottage, got up in the Gothic order.&nbsp; I
stopped to rest a moment, and noticing the good woman setting her tea-table,
I invited myself to a seat at it, on the inn basis, and had a pleasant
meal and chat with her and an under-gamekeeper of the Duke of Portland,
who had come in a little before me.&nbsp; The stories he told me about
the extent of the Duke&rsquo;s possessions were marvellous, more especially
in reference to his game preserves.&nbsp; I should think there must
be a larger number of hares, rabbits and partridges on his estate than
in the whole of New England.&nbsp; As I sat engaged in conversation
with the woman of the house and this accidental guest, an unmistakable
American face met my eyes, as I raised them to the opposite wall.&nbsp;
It was the familiar face of a Bristol clock, made in the Connecticut
village adjoining the one in which I was born.&nbsp; It wore the same
honest expression, which a great many ill-natured people, especially
in our Southern States, have regarded as covering a dishonest and untruthful
mind, or a bad memory of the hours.&nbsp; Still it is the most ubiquitous
<i>Americanism</i> in the world, and it is pleasant to see its face
in so many cottages of laboring men from Land&rsquo;s End to John O&rsquo;Groat&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Mansfield is a very substantial and venerable town, bearing a name
which one distinguished man has rendered illustrious by wearing it through
a brilliant life.&nbsp; It is situated near the celebrated Sherwood
Forest, and is marked by many features of peculiar interest.&nbsp; One
of its noticeable celebrities is the house in which Lord Chesterfield
resided.&nbsp; It is now occupied by a Wesleyan minister, who elaborates
his sermons in the very room, I believe, in which that fashionable nobleman
penned his polite literature for youthful candidates for the uppermost
circles of society.&nbsp; In the centre of the market place there is
a magnificent monument erected to the memory of the late Lord George
Bentinck, who was held in high esteem by the people of the town and
vicinity.&nbsp; The manufactures are pretty much the same as in Nottingham.&nbsp;
They turn out a great production of raw material in red sandstone, very
much resembling our Portland, quite as fine, hard and durable.&nbsp;
Immense blocks of it are quarried and conveyed to London and to all
parts of the kingdom.&nbsp; The town also supplies a vast amount of
moulding sand, of nearly the same color and consistency as that we procure
from Albany.&nbsp; I stopped on my way into the town to take a turn
through the cemetery, which was very beautifully laid out, and looked
like a great garden lawn belted with shrubbery, and illuminated with
the variegated lamps of flowers of every hue and breath.&nbsp; The meandering
walks were all laid with asphalte, which presented a new and striking
contrast to the gorgeous borders and the vivid green of the cleanly
shaven grass.&nbsp; Many of the little graves were made in nests of
geraniums and other modest and sweet-eyed stars of hope.</p>
<p>Next day I had a very enjoyable walk in a north-westerly direction
to Chesterfield.&nbsp; On the way, called in at a blacksmith&rsquo;s
shop, and had a long talk with the smith-in-chief on matters connected
with his trade.&nbsp; The &ldquo;custom-work&rdquo; of such shops in
country villages in England is like that in ours fifty years ago&mdash;embracing
the greatest variety of jobs.&nbsp; Articles now made with us in large
manufacturing establishments at a price which would starve a master
and his apprentice to compete with, are hammered out in these English
shops on a single anvil.&nbsp; On comparing notes with this knight of
the hammer, I learned a fact I had not known before.&nbsp; His price
for horse-shoeing varied according to the size of the hoof, just as
our leather-shoemakers charge according to the foot.&nbsp; On taking
leave of him he intimated, in the most frank and natural way in the
world, that, in our exchange of information, the balance was in his
favor, and that I could not but think it fair to pay him the difference.&nbsp;
I looked at him first inquiringly and doubtingly, embarrassed with the
idea that I had not understood him, or that he was a journeyman and
not the master of the establishment.&nbsp; But he was as free and easy
and natural as possible.&nbsp; An American tobacco-chewer, of fifty
years&rsquo; standing, would not have asked a cut from a neighbor&rsquo;s
&ldquo;lady&rsquo;s twist,&rdquo; or &ldquo;pig-tail&rdquo; in more
perfect good faith.&nbsp; That good, round, English face would have
blushed crimson if the man suspected that I misunderstood him.&nbsp;
Nay, more, he would quite likely have thrown the pennies at my head
if I had offered them to him to buy bread or bacon with for himself
and family.&nbsp; I had no reason for a moment&rsquo;s doubt.&nbsp;
It all meant <i>beer</i>, &ldquo;only that and nothing more;&rdquo;
a mere <i>pour boire</i> souvenir to celebrate our mutual acquaintance.&nbsp;
So I gave him a couple of pennies, just as I would have given him a
bite of tobacco if we had both been in that line.&nbsp; I feared to
give him more, lest he might think I meant bread and bacon and thought
him a beggar.&nbsp; But I ventured to tell him, however, that I did
not use that beverage myself, and hoped he would wish me health in some
better enjoyment.</p>
<p>I saw, for the first time, a number of Spanish cattle feeding in
a pasture.&nbsp; They were large, variously colored animals with the
widely-branching horns that distinguish them.&nbsp; A man must have
a long range of buildings to stable a score of creatures with such horns,
and for that reason they will only be kept as curiosities in these northern
latitudes.&nbsp; And they are curiosities of animal life, heightened
to a wonderment when placed side by side with the black Galloways, or
those British breeds of cattle which have no horns at all.&nbsp; I should
not wonder, however, if this large, cream-colored stock from Spain should
be introduced here to cross with the Durhams, Devons, and Herefords.</p>
<p>When about half-way from Mansfield to Chesterfield, a remarkable
change came over the face of the landscape.&nbsp; The mosaic work of
the hill-sides and valleys showed more green squares than before.&nbsp;
Three-fourths of the fields were meadow or pasture, or in mangel or
turnips.&nbsp; There was but one here and there in wheat or other grain.&nbsp;
The road beneath and the sky above began to blacken, and the chimneys
of coal-pits to thicken.&nbsp; Sooty-faced men, horses and donkeys passed
with loaded carts; and all the premonitory aspects of the &ldquo;black
country&rdquo; multiplied as I proceeded.&nbsp; I do not recollect ever
seeing a landscape change so suddenly in England.</p>
<p>Chesterfield is an intelligent looking town, evidently growing in
population and prosperity.&nbsp; It has its own unique speciality; almost
as strikingly distinctive as that of Strasburg or Pisa.&nbsp; This is
the most ambiguous and mysterious church spire in the world.&nbsp; It
would be very difficult to convey any idea of it by any description
from an unaided pen; and there is nothing extant that would avail as
an illustration.&nbsp; The church is very old and large, and stands
upon a commanding eminence.&nbsp; The massive tower supports a tall
but suddenly tapering spire of the most puzzling construction to the
eye.&nbsp; It must have been designed by a monk of the olden time, with
a Chinese turn of ingenuity.&nbsp; There is no order known to architecture
to furnish a term or likeness for it.&nbsp; A ridgy, spiral spire are
the three most descriptive words, but these are not half enough for
stating the shape, style and posture of this strange steeple.&nbsp;
It is difficult even to assist the imagination to form an idea of it.&nbsp;
I will essay a few words in that direction.&nbsp; Suppose, then, a plain
spire, 100 feet high, in the form of an attenuated cone, planted upon
a heavy church tower.&nbsp; Now, in imagination, plough this cone all
around into deep ridges from top to bottom.&nbsp; Then mount to the
top, and, with a great iron wrench, give it an even twist clear down
to the base, so that each ridge shall wind entirely around the spire
between the bottom and the top.&nbsp; Then, in giving it this screw-looking
twist, bend over the top, with a gentle incline all the way down, so
that it shall be &ldquo;out of perpendicular&rdquo; by about three feet.&nbsp;
Then come down and look at your work, and you will be astonished at
it, standing far or near.&nbsp; The tall, ridgy, curved, conical screw
puzzles you with all sorts of optical illusions.&nbsp; As the eyes in
a front-face portrait follow you around the room in which it is hung,
so this strange spire seems to lean over upon you at every point, as
you walk round the church.&nbsp; Indeed, I believe it was only found
out several centuries after its erection, that it absolutely leaned
more in one direction than another.&nbsp; It is a remarkable sight from
the railway as you approach the town from a distance.&nbsp; If it may
be said reverently, the church, standing on comparatively a hill, not
only lifts its horn on high, but one like that of a rhinoceros, considerably
curved.&nbsp; Just outside the town stands the house in which George
Stephenson lived his last days, and ended his great life of benefaction
to mankind; leaving upon that haloed spot a <i>biograph</i> which the
ages of time to come shall not wash out.</p>
<p>From Chesterfield I diverged westward to see Chatsworth and Haddon
Hall.&nbsp; Whoever makes this walk or ride, let him be sure to stop
at Watch Hill on the way, and look at the view eastward.&nbsp; It is
grander than that of Belvoir Vale, if not so beautiful.</p>
<p>It was a pleasure quite equal to my anticipation to visit Chatsworth
for the first time, after a sojourn in England, off and on, for sixteen
years.&nbsp; It is the lion number three, according to the American
ranking of the historical edifices and localities of England.&nbsp;
Stratford-upon-Avon, Westminster Abbey and Chatsworth are the three
representative celebrities which our travellers think they must visit,
if they would see the life of England&rsquo;s ages from the best stand-points.&nbsp;
And this is the order in which they rank them.&nbsp; Chatsworth and
Haddon Hall should be seen the same day if possible; so that you may
carry the impressions of the one fresh and active into the other.&nbsp;
They are the two most representative buildings in the kingdom.&nbsp;
Haddon is old English feudalism <i>edificed</i>.&nbsp; It represents
the rough grandeur, hospitality, wassail and rude romance of the English
nobility five hundred years ago.&nbsp; It was all in its glory about
the time when Thomas-a-Becket the Magnificent used to entertain great
companies of belted knights of the realm in a manner that exceeded regal
munificence in those days,&mdash;even directing fresh straw to be laid
for them on his ample mansion floor, that they might not soil the bravery
of their dresses when they bunked down for the night.&nbsp; The building
is brimful of the character and history of that period.&nbsp; Indeed,
there are no two milestones of English history so near together, and
yet measuring such a space of the nation&rsquo;s life and manners between
them, as this hall and that of Chatsworth.&nbsp; It was built, of course,
in the bow-and-arrow times, when the sun had to use the same missiles
in shooting its barbed rays into the narrow apertures of old castles&mdash;or
the stone coffins of fear-hunted knights and ladies, as they might be
called.&nbsp; What a monument this to the dispositions and habits of
the world, outside and inside, of that early time!&nbsp; Here is the
porter&rsquo;s or warder&rsquo;s lodge just inside the huge gate.&nbsp;
To think of a living being with a human soul in him burrowing in such
a place!&mdash;a big, black sarcophagus without a lid to it, set deep
in the solid wall.&nbsp; Then there is the chapel.&nbsp; Compare it
with that of Chatsworth, and you may count almost on your fingers the
centuries that have intervened between them.&nbsp; It was new-roofed
soon after the discovery of America, and perhaps done up to some show
of decency and comfort.&nbsp; But how small and rude the pulpit and
pews&mdash;looking like rough-boarded potato-bins!&nbsp; Here is the
great banquet-hall, full to overflowing with the tracks and cross-tracks
of that wild, strange life of old.&nbsp; There is a fire-place for you,
and a mark in the chimney-back of five hundred Christmas logs.&nbsp;
Doubtless this great stone pavement of a floor was carpeted with straw
at these banquets, after the illustrious Becket&rsquo;s pattern.&nbsp;
Here is a memento of the feast hanging up at the top of the kitchenward
door;&mdash;a pair of roughly-forged, rusty handcuffs amalgamated into
one pair of jaws, like a musk-rat trap.&nbsp; What was the use of that
thing, conductor?&nbsp; &ldquo;That, sir, they put the &rsquo;ands in
of them as shirked and didn&rsquo;t drink up all the wine as was poured
into their cups, and there they made them stand on tiptoe up against
that door, sir, before all the company, sir, until they was ashamed
of theirselves.&rdquo;&nbsp; Descend into the kitchen, all scarred with
the tremendous cookery of ages.&nbsp; Here they roasted bullocks whole,
and just back in that dark vault with a slit or two in it for the light,
they killed and dressed them.&nbsp; There are the relics of the shambles.&nbsp;
And here is the great form on which they cut them up into manageable
pieces.&nbsp; It would do you good, you Young America, to see that form,
and the cross-gashes of the meat-axe in it.&nbsp; It is the half of
a gigantic English oak, which was growing in Julius Caesar&rsquo;s time,
sawed through lengthwise, making a top surface several feet wide, black
and smooth as ebony.&nbsp; Some of the bark still clings to the under
side.&nbsp; The dancing hall is the great room of the building.&nbsp;
All that the taste, art and wealth of that day could do, was done to
make it a splendid apartment, and it would pass muster still as a comfortable
and respectable <i>salon</i>.&nbsp; As we pass out, you may decipher
the short prayer cut in the wasting stone of a side portal, &ldquo;GOD
SAVE THE VERNONS!&rdquo;&nbsp; I hope this prayer has been favorably
answered; for history records much virtue in the family, mingled with
some romantic <i>escapades</i>, which have contributed, I believe, to
the entertainment of many novel readers.</p>
<p>Just what Haddon Hall was to the baronial life and society of England
five hundred years ago, is Chatsworth to the full stature of modern
civilization and aristocratic wealth, taste and position.&nbsp; Of this
it is probably the best measure and representative in the kingdom; and
as such it possesses a special value and interest to the world at large.&nbsp;
Were it not for here and there such an establishment, we should lack
waymarks in the progress of the arts, sciences and tastes of advancing
civilization.&nbsp; Governments and joint-stock companies may erect
and fill, with a world of utilities and curiosities of ancient and modern
times, British Museums, National Galleries, Crystal Palaces and Polytechnic
Institutions; but not one of these, nor the Louvre, nor Versailles,
nor the Tuileries can compete with one private mind, taste and will
concentrated upon one great work for a lifetime, when endowed with the
requisite perceptions and means competent to carry that work to the
highest perfection of science, genius and art.&nbsp; Museums, galleries
and public institutions of art are exclusively <i>visiting</i> places.&nbsp;
The elegancies of <i>home</i> life are all shut out of their attractions.&nbsp;
You see in them the work and presence of a committee, or corporation,
often in discrepant layers of taste and plan.&nbsp; One mind does not
stand out or above the whole, fashioning the <i>tout-ensemble</i> to
the symmetrical lines of one governing, all-pervading and shaping thought.&nbsp;
You see no exquisite artistry of drawing-room or boudoir elegance and
luxury running through living apartments of home, out into the conservatories,
lawns, gardens, park and all its surroundings and embellishments, making
the whole like a great illuminated volume of family life, which you
may peruse page by page, and trace the same pen and the same story from
beginning to end.&nbsp; Even the grandest royal residences lack, in
this quality, what you will find at Chatsworth.&nbsp; They all show
the sharp-edged strata of unaffiliated tastes and styles of different
ages and artists.&nbsp; They lack the oneness of a single individuality,
of one great symmetrical conception.</p>
<p>This one-mindedness, this one-man power of conception and execution
gives to the Duke of Devonshire&rsquo;s palace at Chatsworth an interest
and a value that probably do not attach to any other private establishment
in England.&nbsp; In this felicitous characteristic it stands out in
remarkable prominence and in striking contrast with nearly all the other
baronial halls of the country.&nbsp; It is the parlor pier-glass of
the present century.&nbsp; It reflects the two images in vivid apposition&mdash;the
brilliant civilization of this last, unfinished age in which we live
and the life of bygone centuries; that is, if Haddon Hall shows its
face in it, or if you have the features of that antiquity before your
eyes when you look into the Chatsworth mirror.&nbsp; The whole of this
magnificent establishment bears the impress of the nineteenth century,
inside and outside.&nbsp; The architecture, sculpture, carving, paintings,
engravings, furniture, libraries, conservatories, flowers, shrubberies
and rockeries all bear and honor the finger-prints of modern taste and
art.&nbsp; In no casket in England, probably, have so many jewels of
this century&rsquo;s civilization been treasured for posterity as in
this mansion on the little meandering Derwent.&nbsp; If England has
no grand National Gallery like the French Louvre, she has works of art
that would fill fifty Louvres, collected and treasured in these quiet
private halls, embosomed in green parks and plantations, from one end
of the land to the other.&nbsp; And in no other country are the private
treasure-houses of genius so accessible to the public as in this.&nbsp;
They doubtless act as educational centres for refining the habits of
the nation; exerting an influence that reaches and elevates the homes
of the people, cultivating in them new perceptions of beauty and comfort;
diffusing a taste for embowering even humble cottages in shrubbery;
making little flower-fringed lawns, six feet by eight or less; rockeries
and ferneries, and artificial ruins of castles or abbeys of smaller
dimensions still.</p>
<p>In passing through the galleries and gardens of Chatsworth you will
recognise the originals of many works of art which command the admiration
of the world.&nbsp; The most familiar to the American visitor will probably
be the great painting of the Bolton Abbey Scene, the engravings of which
are so numerous and admired on both sides of the Atlantic.&nbsp; But
there is the original of a greater work, which has made the wonder of
the age.&nbsp; It is the original of the Great Crystal Palace of 1851,
and the mother of all the palaces of the same structure which have been
or will be erected in time past or to come.&nbsp; Here it diadems at
Chatsworth the choice plants and flowers of all the tropics; presenting
a model which needed only expansion, and some modifications, to furnish
the reproduction that delighted the world in Hyde Park in 1851.</p>
<p>I was pleasantly impressed with one feature of the economy that ruled
at Chatsworth.&nbsp; Although there were between one and two thousand
deer flecking the park, it was utilised to the pasture of humbler and
more useful animals.&nbsp; Over one hundred poor people&rsquo;s cows
were feeding demurely over its vast extent, even to the gilded gates
of the palace.&nbsp; They are charged only &pound;2 for the season;
which is very moderate, even cheaper than the stony pasturage around
the villages of New England.&nbsp; I noticed a flock of Spanish sheep,
black-and-white, looking like a drove of Berkshire hogs, and seemingly
clothed with bristles instead of wool.&nbsp; They are kept rather as
curiosities than for use.</p>
<p>Chatsworth, with all its treasures and embodiments of wealth, art
and genius, with an estate continuous in one direction for about thirty
miles, is but one of the establishments of the Duke of Devonshire.&nbsp;
He owns a palace on the Thames that might crown the ambition of a German
prince.&nbsp; He also counts in his possessions old abbeys, baronial
halls, parks and towns that once were walled, and still have streets
called after their gates.&nbsp; If any country is to have a personage
occupying such a position, it is well to have a considerable number
of the same class, to <i>yeomanise</i> such an aristocracy&mdash;to
make each feel that he has his peers in fifty others.&nbsp; Otherwise
an isolated duke would have to live and move outside the pale of human
society; a proud, haughty entity dashing about, with not even a comet&rsquo;s
orbit nor any fixed place in the constellation of a nation&rsquo;s communities.&nbsp;
It is of great necessity to him, independent of political considerations,
that there is a House of Peers instituted, in which he may find his
social level; where he may meet his equals in considerable numbers,
and feel himself but a man.</p>

<p>From Chatsworth I went on to Sheffield, crossing a hilly moorland
belonging to the Duke of Rutland, and containing 10,000 acres in one
solid block.&nbsp; It was all covered with heather, and kept in this
wild, bleak condition for game.&nbsp; Here and there well-cultivated
farms, as it were, bit into this cold waste, rescuing large, square
morsels of land, and making them glow with the warm flush and glory
of luxuriant harvests; thus showing how such great reaches of desert
may be made to blossom like the rose under the hand of human labor.</p>
<p>Here is Sheffield, down here, sweltering, smoking, and sweating,
with face like the tan, under the walls of these surrounding hills.&nbsp;
Here live and labor Briareus and Cyclops of modern mythology.&nbsp;
Here they&mdash;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swing their heavy sledge,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With
measured beats and slow;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the
sexton ringing the village bell,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When
the evening sun is low.</p>
<p>Here live the lineal descendants of Thor, christianised to human
industries.&nbsp; Here the great hammer of the Scandinavian Thunderer
descended, took nest, and hatched a brood of ten thousand little iron
beetles for beating iron and steel into shapes and uses that Tubal Cain
never dreamed of.&nbsp; Here you may hear their clatter night and day
upon a thousand anvils.&nbsp; O, Vale of Vulcan!&nbsp; O, Valley of
Knives!&nbsp; Was ever a boy put into trousers, in either hemisphere,
that did not carry in the first pocket made for him one of thy cheap
blades?&nbsp; Did ever a reaper in the Old World or New cut and bind
a sheaf of grain, who did not wield one of thy famous sickles?&nbsp;
All Americans who were boys forty years ago, will remember three English
centres of peculiar interest to them.&nbsp; These were Sheffield, Colebrook
Dale, and Paternoster Row.&nbsp; There was hardly a house or log cabin
between the Penobscot and the Mississippi which could not show the imprint
of these three places, on the iron tea-kettle, the youngest boy&rsquo;s
Barlow knife, and his younger sister&rsquo;s picture-book.&nbsp; To
the juvenile imagination of those times, Sheffield was a huge jack-knife,
Colebrook Dale a porridge-pot, and Paternoster Row a psalm-book, each
in the generative case.&nbsp; How we young reapers used to discuss the
comparative merits and meanings of those mysterious letters on our sickles,
B.Y and I.R!&nbsp; What were they?&nbsp; Were they beginnings of words,
or whole words themselves?&nbsp; Did they stand for things, qualities,
or persons?&nbsp; &ldquo;Mine is a <i>By</i> sickle; mine is an <i>Ir</i>
one.&nbsp; Mine is the best,&rdquo; says the last, &ldquo;for it has
the finest teeth and the best curve.&rdquo;&nbsp; That was our boys&rsquo;
talk in walking through the rye, with bent backs and red faces, a little
behind our fathers; who cut a wider work to enable us to keep near them.</p>
<p>In what blacksmith shop or hardware house in America does not Sheffield
show its face and faculties?&nbsp; Did any American, knowing the difference
between cast-iron and cast-steel, ever miss the sight of Naylor and
Sanderson&rsquo;s yellow labels in his travels?&nbsp; How many millions
of acres of primeval forest have the ages edged with their fine steel
cut through, and given to the plough!&nbsp; Fashion has its Iron Age
as well as its Golden; and, what is more remarkable, the first of the
two has come last, in the fitful histories of custom.&nbsp; And this
last freak of feminine taste has brought a wonderful grist of additional
business to the Sheffield mill.&nbsp; The fair Eugenie has done a good
thing for this smoky town, well deserving of a monument of burnished
steel erected to her memory on one of these hills.&nbsp; More than this;
as Empress of Crinoline, she should wear the iron crown of Charlemagne
in her own right.&nbsp; Her husband&rsquo;s empire is but a mere <i>arondissement</i>
compared with the domain that does homage to her sceptre.&nbsp; Sheffield
is the great arsenal of her armaments.&nbsp; Sheffield cases ships of
war with iron plates a foot thick; but that is nothing, in pounds avoirdupois,
compared with the weight of steel it spins into elastic springs for
casing the skirts of two hundred millions of the fair Eugenie&rsquo;s
sex and lieges in the two hemispheres.&nbsp; It is estimated that ten
thousand tons of steel are annually absorbed into this use in Christendom;
and Sheffield, doubtless, furnishes a large proportion of it.</p>
<p>Here I had another involuntary walk, not put down in the programme
of my expectations.&nbsp; On inquiring the way to Fir Vale, a picturesque
suburb where a friend resided, I was directed to a locality which, it
was suggested, must be the one I meant, though it was called Fir View.&nbsp;
I followed the direction given for a considerable distance, when it
was varied successively by persons of whom I occasionally inquired.&nbsp;
After ascending and descending a number of steep hills, I suddenly came
down upon the town again from the south, having made a complete circuit
of it; a performance that cost me about two hours of time and much unsatisfactory
perspiration.&nbsp; Fearing that a second attempt would be equally unsuccessful,
I took the Leeds road, and left the Jericho at the first round.&nbsp;
Walked about nine miles to a furnace-lighted village called very appropriately
Hoyland, or Highland, when anglicised from the Danish.&nbsp; It commands
truly a grand view of wooded hills and deep valleys dashed with the
sheen of ripened grain.</p>
<p>The next day I passed through a good sample section of England&rsquo;s
wealth and industry.&nbsp; Mansions and parks of the gentry, hill, valley,
wheat-fields, meadows of the most vivid green; crops luxuriant in most
picturesque alternations; in a word, the whole a vista of the richest
agricultural scenery.&nbsp; And yet out of the brightest and broadest
fields of wheat, barley and oats, towered up the colliery chimneys in
every direction, like good-natured and swarthy giants smoking their
pipes complacently and &ldquo;with comfortable breasts&rdquo; in view
of the goodly scene.&nbsp; The golden grain grew thick and tall up to
the very pit&rsquo;s mouth.&nbsp; In the sun-light above and gas-light
below human industry was plying its differently-bitted implements.&nbsp;
There were men reaping and studding the pathway of their sickles through
the field with thickly-planted sheaves.&nbsp; But right under them,
a hundred fathoms deep, subterranean farmers were at work, with black
and sweaty brows, garnering the coal-harvest sown there before the Flood.&nbsp;
Sickle above and pick below were gathering simultaneously the layers
of wealth that Nature had stored in her parlor and cellar for man.</p>
<p>I passed through Barnsley and Wakefield on this day&rsquo;s walk,&mdash;towns
full of profitable industries and busy populations, and growing in both
after the American impulse and expansion.&nbsp; If the good &ldquo;Vicar
of Wakefield&rdquo; of the olden time could revisit the scene of his
earthly experience, and look upon the old church of his ministry as
it now appears, renovated from bottom to the top of its grand and lofty
spire, he would not be entrapped again so easily into assent to the
Greek apothegm of the swindler.</p>
<p>I lodged at a little village inn between Wakefield and Leeds, after
a day of the most enjoyable walk that I had made.&nbsp; Never before,
between sun and sun, had I passed over such a section of above-ground
and under-ground industry and wealth.&nbsp; The next morning I continued
northward, and noticed still more striking combinations of natural productions
and human industries than on the preceding day.&nbsp; One small, rural
area in which these were blended impressed me greatly, and I stopped
to photograph the scene on my mind.&nbsp; In a circle hardly a third
of a mile in diameter, there was the heaviest crop of oats growing that
I had yet seen in England; in another part of the same field there was
a large brick-kiln; in another, an extensive quarry and machinery for
sawing the stone into all sizes and shapes; then a furnace for casting
iron, and lastly, a coal mine; and all these departments of labor and
production were in full operation.&nbsp; It is quite possible that not
one of the hundred laborers on and under this ten-acre patch ever thought
it an extraordinary focus of production.&nbsp; Perhaps even the proprietors
and managers of the five different enterprises worked on the small space
had taken its rich and diversified fertilities as a matter of course,
as we take the rain, light and heat of summer; but to a traveller &ldquo;taking
stock&rdquo; of a country&rsquo;s resources, it could not but be a point
of view exciting admiration.&nbsp; I left it behind me deeply impressed
with the conviction that I had seen the most productive ten-acre field
that could be found on the surface of the globe, counting in the variety
and value of its surface and sub-surface crops.</p>
<p>I took tea with a friend in Leeds, remaining only an hour or two
in that town, then pursuing my course northward.&nbsp; The wide world
knows so much of Leeds that any notice that I could give of it might
seem affected and presumptuous.&nbsp; It is to the Cloth-World what
Rome is to the Catholic.&nbsp; Its Cloth Hall is the St. Peter&rsquo;s
of Coat-and-trouserdom.&nbsp; Its rivers, streams and canals run black
and blue with the stringent juices of all the woods and weeds of the
world used in dyeing.&nbsp; The woods of all the continents come floating
in here, like baled summer clouds of heaven.&nbsp; It is a city of magnipotent
chimneys; and they stand thick and tall on the hills and in the valleys
around, and puff their black breathings into the face and eyes of the
sky above, baconising its countenance, and giving it no time to wash
up and look sober, calm and clean, except a few hours on the sabbath.&nbsp;
<i>The</i> <i>Leeds Mercury</i> is a power in the land, and everybody
who reads the English language in either hemisphere knows Edward Baines
by name.</p>
<p>As I emerged from the great, busy town on the north, I passed by
the estates and residences of its manufacturing aristocracy.&nbsp; The
homes they have built and embellished should satisfy the tastes and
ambitions of any hereditary nobility.&nbsp; They need only a little
more age to make them rival many baronial establishments.&nbsp; It is
interesting to see how the different classes of society are stepping
into each other&rsquo;s shoes in going up into higher grades of social
life.&nbsp; The merchant and manufacturing princes of England have not
only reached but surpassed the conditions of wealth, taste and elegance
which the hereditary peers of the realm occupied a century ago; while
the latter have gone up to the rich and luxurious surroundings of kings
and queens of that period.&nbsp; The upward movement has reached the
very lowest strata of society.&nbsp; Not only have the small tradesmen
and farmers ascended to the comfortable conditions of large merchants
and landowners of one hundred years ago, but common day laborers are
lifted upward by the general uprising.&nbsp; I should not wonder if
all the damp, low cellarless cottages they now frequently inhabit should
be swept away in less than fifty years and replaced by as comfortable
buildings as the great middle class occupied in the childhood of the
present generation.</p>
<p>I found comfortable quarters for the night in the little village
of Bramhope, about five miles from Leeds.&nbsp; The next day I walked
to Harrogate, passing through Otley and across the celebrated Wharf
Vale.&nbsp; The scenery of this valley, as it opens upon you suddenly
on descending from the south into Otley, is exceedingly beautiful; not
so extensive as that of Belvoir Vale, but with all the features of the
latter landscape compressed in a smaller space; like a portrait taken
on a smaller scale.&nbsp; As you look off from the southern ridge or
wall of the valley, you seem to stand on the cord of a segment of a
circle, the radius of which touches the horizon at about five miles
to the north.&nbsp; This crescent is filled with the most delicate lineaments
of Nature&rsquo;s beauty.&nbsp; The opposite walls of the gallery slope
upward from the meandering Wharf so gently and yet reach the blue ceiling
of the sky so near, that all the paintings that panel them are vividly
distinct to your eye, and you can group all their lights and shades
in the compass of a single glance.</p>
<p>On the opposite side, half hidden and half revealed among the trees
of an ample park, stands Farnley Hall, a historical residence of an
old historical family.&nbsp; I had a letter of introduction to the present
proprietor, Mr. Fawkes, who, I hope, will not deem it a disparagement
to be called one of the Knights of the Shorthorns&mdash;a more extensive,
useful, and cosmopolitan order than were the Knights of Rhodes or of
Malta.&nbsp; Unfortunately for me, he was not at home; but his steward,
a very intelligent, gentlemanly and genial man, took me over the establishment,
and showed me all the stock that was stabled, mostly bulls of different
ages.&nbsp; They were all of the best families of Shorthorn blood, and
a better connoisseur of animal life than myself could not have enjoyed
the sight of such well-made creatures more thoroughly than I did.&nbsp;
The prince of the blood, in my estimation, was &ldquo;Lord Cobham,&rdquo;
a cream-colored bull, with which compared that famous animal in Greek
mythology which played himself off as such an Adonis among the bovines,
must have been a shabby, scraggy quadruped.&nbsp; Poor Europa! it would
have been bad enough if she had been run away with by a &ldquo;Lord
Cobham.&rdquo;&nbsp; But the like of him did not live in her day.</p>
<p>After going through the housings for cattle, the steward took me
to the Hall, a grand old mansion full of English history, especially
of the Commonwealth period.&nbsp; Indeed, one large apartment was a
museum of relics of that stirring and stormy time.&nbsp; There, against
the antique, carved wainscoting, hung the great broad-brim of Oliver
Cromwell, with a circumference nearly as large as an opened umbrella,
heavy, coarse and grim.&nbsp; There hung a sword he wielded in the fiery
rifts of battle.&nbsp; There was Fairfax&rsquo;s sword hanging by its
side; and his famous war-drum lay beneath.&nbsp; Its leather lungs,
that once shouted the charge, were now still and frowsy, with no martial
speech left in them.</p>
<p>Mr. Fawkes owns about 15,000 acres of land, including most of the
valley of Otley, and extending back almost to Harrogate.&nbsp; He farms
about 450 acres, but grows no wheat.&nbsp; Indeed, I did not see a field
of it in a circle of five miles&rsquo; diameter.</p>
<p>I reached Harrogate in the dusk of the evening, and found the town
alive with people mostly in the streets.&nbsp; It is a snug and cozy
little Saratoga among the hills of Yorkshire, away from the smoke, soot
and savor of the great manufacturing centres.&nbsp; It is a favorite
resort for a mild class of invalids, and of persons who need the medicine
of pure air and gentle exercise, blended with the quiet tonics of cheery
mirth and recreation.&nbsp; Superadded to all these stimulants, there
is a mineral spring at which the visitors, young and old, drink most
voluminously.&nbsp; I went down to it in the morning before breakfast,
and found it thronged by a multitude of men, women and children, who
drank off great goblets of it with astonishing faith and facility.&nbsp;
The rotunda was so filled with the fumes of sulphur that I found it
more easy to inhale than to imbibe, and preferred to satisfy that sense
as to the merits of the water.</p>
<p>The next day I reached the brave old city of Ripon.&nbsp; On the
way I stopped an hour or two at Ripley and visited the castle.&nbsp;
The building itself is a good specimen of the baronial hall of the olden
time.&nbsp; But the gardens and grounds constitute its distinguishing
feature.&nbsp; I never saw before such an exquisite arrangement of flowers,
even at Chatsworth or the Kew Gardens.&nbsp; All forms imaginable were
produced by them.&nbsp; The most extensive and elaborate combination
was a row of flower sofas reaching around the garden.&nbsp; Each was
from 20 to 30 feet in length.&nbsp; The seat was wrought in geraniums
of every tint, all grown to an even, compact surface, presenting figures
as diversified as the alternating hues could produce.&nbsp; The back
was worked in taller flowers, presenting the same evenness of line and
surface.&nbsp; On entering the garden gate and catching the first sight
of these beautiful structures, you take them for veritable sofas, as
perfectly wrought as anything was ever done in Berlin wool.</p>
<p>Ripon is an interesting little city, with a fact-roll of history
reaching back into the dimmest centuries of the land.&nbsp; It has run
the gauntlet of all the Saxon, Danish, Scotch and Norman raids and <i>regimes</i>.&nbsp;
It was burnt once or twice by each of these races in the struggle for
supremacy.&nbsp; But with a plucky tenacity of life, it arose successively
out of its own ashes and spread its ph&oelig;nix wings to a new and
vigorous vitality.&nbsp; A venerable cathedral looks down upon it with
a motherly face.&nbsp; Unique old buildings, with half their centuries
unrecorded and lost in oblivion, stand to this day in good repair, as
the homes of happy children, who play at marbles and the last sports
of the day just as if they were born in houses only a year older than
themselves.&nbsp; Institutions and customs older than the cathedral
are kept up with a filial faith in their virtue.&nbsp; One of the most
interesting of these, I believe, was established by the Saxon Edgar
or Alfred&mdash;it matters not which; they were only a century or two
apart, and that space is but a trifling circumstance in the history
of this old country.&nbsp; One of these kings appointed an officer called
a &ldquo;wakeman&rdquo; for the town.&nbsp; He must originally have
been a kind of secular beadle of the community, or a curfew constable,
to see the whole population well a-bed in good season.&nbsp; One of
his duties consisted in blowing a horn every night at nine o&rsquo;clock
as a signal to turn in.&nbsp; But a remarkable consideration was attached
to faithful compliance with this summons.&nbsp; If any house or shop
was robbed before sunrise, a tax was levied upon every inhabitant, of
4d. if his house had one outer door, and of 8d. if it had two.&nbsp;
This tax was to compensate the sufferer for his loss, and also to put
the whole community under bonds to keep the peace and to feel responsible
for the safety of each other&rsquo;s property.&nbsp; Thus it not only
acted as a great mutual insurance company of which every householder
was a member, but it made him, as it were, a special constable against
burglary.&nbsp; This old Saxon institution is in full life and vigor
to-day.&nbsp; The wakeman is still the highest secular official of the
town.&nbsp; For a thousand consecutive years the wakeman&rsquo;s toot-horn
has been blown at night over the successive generations of the little
cathedral city.&nbsp; This is an interesting fact, full of promise.&nbsp;
No American could fail to admire this conservatism who appreciates national
individuality.&nbsp; No one, at heart, could more highly esteem these
salient traits of a people&rsquo;s character.&nbsp; And here I may as
well put in a few thoughts on this subject as at any stage of my walk.</p>
<p>Good-natured reader, are you a man of sensitive perceptions as to
the proprieties and dignities of dress and deportment which should characterise
some great historical personage whose name you have held in profound
veneration all your life long?&nbsp; Now, in the wayward drift of your
imagination among the freaks of modern fashion, did it ever dare to
present before your eyes St. Paul in strapped pantaloons, figured velvet
vest, swallow-tailed coat, stove-pipe hat, and a cockney glass at his
eye?&nbsp; Did your fancy, in its wildest fictions, ever pass such an
image across the speculum of your mental vision?</p>
<p>Gentle reader, &ldquo;in maiden meditation, fancy free,&rdquo; did
a dreamy thought of yours ever stray through the histories of your sex
and its modes of dress and adornment, and so blend or transpose them
as to present to you, in a sudden flash of the imagination, the Virgin
Mary dressed like the Empress Eugenie?&nbsp; Readers both, did not that
fancy trouble you, as if an unholy thought had fallen into the soul?&nbsp;
Well, a thought like that must trouble the American when his fancy passes
before his mind&rsquo;s eye the image of Old England <i>Americanised</i>.&nbsp;
And a faculty more serious and trusty than fancy will present this transformation
to him, day by day, as he visits the great centres of the nation&rsquo;s
life and industry.&nbsp; In London, Manchester, Liverpool, and all the
most busy and prosperous commercial and manufacturing towns, he will
see that England is becoming Americanised shockingly fast.&nbsp; In
all these populous places it is losing the old individuality that once
distinguished the grandfatherland of fifty millions who now speak its
language beyond the sea.&nbsp; Look at London! look at the miles of
three and four story houses under the mason&rsquo;s hands, now running
out in every direction from the city.&nbsp; Will you see a single feature
of the Old England of our common memories in them?&nbsp; No, not one!
no more than in a modern English dress-coat, or in one of the iron rails
of the British Great Western, or of the Illinois Central.&nbsp; It is
doubtful if there will be anything of England left in London at the
end of the next fifty years, unless it be the fog and the Lord Mayor&rsquo;s
Show.&nbsp; Already the radicals are crying out against both of these
institutions, which are merely local, by the way.&nbsp; The tailor&rsquo;s
shears, the mason&rsquo;s trowel, and the carpenter&rsquo;s edge-tools
are evening everything in Christendom to one dead level of uniformity.&nbsp;
The railroads and telegraphs are all working to the same end.&nbsp;
All these agencies of modern civilization at first lay their innovating
hands upon large cities or commercial centres.&nbsp; Thence they work
outward slowly and transform the appearance and habits of the country.&nbsp;
The transformations I have noticed in England since 1846 are wonderful,
utilitarian, and productive of absolute and rigid comfort to the people;
still, I must confess, they inspire in me a sentiment akin to that which
our village fathers experienced when the old church in which they worshipped
from childhood was pulled down to make room for a better one.</p>
<p>To every American, sympathising with these sentiments, it must be
interesting to visit such a rural little city as Ripon, and find populations
that cling with reverence and affection to the old Saxon institutions
of Alfred.&nbsp; It will make him feel that he stands in the unbroken
lineage of the centuries, to hear the wakeman&rsquo;s horn, and to know
that it has been blown, spring, summer, autumn and winter, in all weathers,
in weal and in woe, for a thousand years.&nbsp; As Old England is driven
farther and farther back from London, Manchester, Liverpool, and other
great improving towns, she will find refuge and residence in these retired
country villages.&nbsp; Here she will wear longest and last the features
in which she was engraven on the minds of all the millions who call
her mother beyond the sea.</p>
<p>The next day I visited the celebrated Fountain Abbey in Studley Park,&mdash;a
grand relic of antiquity, framed with silver and emerald work of lakelets,
lawns, shrubberies and trees as beautifully arranged as art, taste and
wealth could set them.&nbsp; The old abbey is a majestic ruin which
fills one with wonder as he looks up at its broken arches and towers
and sees the dimensions marked by the pedestals or foot-prints of its
templed columns.&nbsp; It stands rather in a narrow glen than in a valley,
and was commenced, it is supposed, about 1130.&nbsp; The yew-trees under
which the monks bivouacked while at work upon the magnificent edifice,
are still standing, bearing leaves as large and green as those that
covered the enthusiastic architects of that early time.&nbsp; In the
height of its prosperity and power, the lands of the abbey embraced
over 72,000 acres.&nbsp; The Park enclosing this great monument of an
earlier age contains 250 acres, and is really an earthly elysium of
beauty.&nbsp; It was comforting to learn that it was laid out so late
as 1720, and that all the noble trees that filled it had grown to their
present grandeur within the intervening period.&nbsp; Here I saw for
the first time in England our hard-maple.&nbsp; It was a spindling thing,
looking as if it had suffered much from fever and ague or rheumatism;
but it was pleasant to see it admitted into a larger fellowship of trees
than our New England soil ever bore.&nbsp; On a green, lawn-faced slope,
at the turning of the principal walk, there was a little tree a few
feet high enclosed in by a circular wire fence.&nbsp; It was planted
by the Princess of Wales on a visit of the royal pair to Studley soon
after their marriage.&nbsp; The fair Dane left her card in this way
to the old Abbey, which began to rise upon its foundations soon after
the stalwart Danish sovereign of England fell at the Battle of Hastings.&nbsp;
Will any one of her posterity ever bear his name and sit upon the throne
he vacated for that bloody grave?&nbsp; No!&nbsp; She will remember
a better name at the font.&nbsp; The day and the name of the Harolds,
Williams, Henrys, Charles&rsquo;s, and Georges are over and gone forever.&nbsp;
ALBERT THE GOOD has estopped that succession; and England, doubtless,
for centuries to come, will wear that name and its memories in her crown.</p>
<p>After spending a few hours at Studley Park, I returned to Ripon and
went on to Thirsk, where I spent the Sabbath with a Friend.&nbsp; The
next day he drove me over to Rievaulx Abbey, which was the mother of
Fountain Abbey.&nbsp; On the way to it we passed the ruins of another
of these grand structures of that religious age, called Byland Abbey,
where Robert Bruce came within an ace of capturing King Edward on his
retreat from Scotland, after the Battle of Bannockburn.</p>
<p>One of the objects of this excursion was to visit the establishment
of Lord Faversham, near Helmsley, who is one of the most scientific
and successful stock-raisers, of the Shorthorn blood, in England, and
to whom I had a note of introduction.&nbsp; But he, too, was not at
home, which I much regretted, as I was desirous of seeing one of the
peers of the realm who enter into this culture of animal life with so
much personal interest and assiduity.&nbsp; His manager, however, was
very affable and attentive, ready and pleased to give any information
desired upon different points.&nbsp; He showed us a splendid set of
animals.&nbsp; Indeed, I had never seen a herd to equal it.&nbsp; There
were several bulls of different ages with a perfection of form truly
admirable.&nbsp; Some of them had already drawn first prizes at different
shows.&nbsp; Several noble specimens of this celebrated herd have been
sold to stock-raisers in America, Australia and in continental countries.&nbsp;
The most perfect of all the well-made animals on the establishment,
according to my untrained perceptions of symmetry, was a milk-white
cow, called &ldquo;The Lady in White,&rdquo; three years old.&nbsp;
She and Mr. Fawkes&rsquo; &ldquo;Lord Cobham&rdquo; should be shown
together.&nbsp; I doubt if a better mated pair could be found in England.&nbsp;
There was a large number of cows feeding in the park which would command
admiration at any exhibition of stock.&nbsp; Lord Faversham&rsquo;s
famous &ldquo;Skyrocket&rdquo; ended his days with much <i>eclat</i>.&nbsp;
When getting into years, and into monstrous obesity, he was presented
as a contribution to the Lancashire Relief Fund.&nbsp; Before passing
into the butcher&rsquo;s hands, he was exhibited in Leeds, and realised
about &pound;200 as a show.&nbsp; Thus as a curiosity first, and as
a small mountain of fat beef afterward, he proved a generous gift to
the suffering operatives in the manufacturing districts.</p>
<p>Passing through the park gate, we entered upon a lawn esplanade looking
down upon the ruins of Rievaulx Abbey.&nbsp; This broad terrace extended
for apparently a half of a mile, and was as finely carpeted piece of
ground as you will find in England.&nbsp; No hair of horse or dog groomed
and brushed with the nicest care, and soft and shining with the healthiest
vitality, could surpass in delicacy and life of surface the grass coverlet
of this long terrace, from which you looked down upon that grand monument
of twelfth-century architecture half veiled among the trees of the glen.&nbsp;
This was one of the oldest abbeys in the north of England, and the mother
of several of them.&nbsp; Some of its walls are still as entire and
perfect as those of Tintern, on the Wye.&nbsp; It was founded by the
monks of the St. Bernard order, in 1131, according to the historical
record.&nbsp; Really those black-cowled masons and carvers must have
given the enthusiasm and genius of the early painters of the Virgin
to these magnificent structures.&nbsp; I will not go into the subject
at large here, leaving it to form an entire chapter, when I have seen
most of the old abbeys of the country.&nbsp; In looking up at their
walls, arches and columns, one marvels to see the most delicate and
elaborate vine and flower-work of the carver&rsquo;s chisel apparently
as perfect as when it engraved the last line; and this, too, in face
of the frosts and beating storms of six hundred years.&nbsp; The largest
ivy I ever saw buttressed one of the windowed walls with ten thousand
cross-folded fingers and foliage of vivid green piled thick and high
upon the teeth-marks of time.&nbsp; The trunk was a full foot through
at the butt.&nbsp; A few years ago a large mound was uncovered near
the ruin, and found to be composed of cinders, showing incontestably
that the monks had worked iron ore very extensively, thus teaching the
common people that art as well as agriculture.&nbsp; These cinders have
been used very largely in repairing the roads for a considerable distance
around.</p>
<p>On returning to Thirsk over the Hambleton range of hills, we crossed
thousands of acres of moor-land covered with heather in full bloom,
looking like a purple sea.&nbsp; It was a splendid sight.&nbsp; My friend,
who was an artist, stopped for a while to sketch one or two views of
the scene.&nbsp; As we proceeded, we saw several green and golden fields
impinging upon this florid waste, serving to illustrate what might be
done with the vast tracts of land in England and Scotland now bristling
with this thick and prickly vegetation.&nbsp; The heatherland over which
we were passing was utilised in a rather singular manner.&nbsp; It yielded
pasturage to two sets of industrials&mdash;sheep and bees.&nbsp; As
the heather blossom is thought to impart a peculiarly pleasant flavor
to honey, I was told many bee-stock-raisers of Lincolnshire brought
their hives to this section to pasture them for a season on this purple
prairie.</p>
<p>The westward view from the precipitous heights of the Hambleton ridge
is one of the most beautiful and extensive you will find in England,
well worth a special journey to see it.&nbsp; The declining sun was
flooding the great basin with the day&rsquo;s last, best smile, filling
it to the golden rim of the horizon with a soft light in which lay a
landscape of thirty miles&rsquo; depth, embracing full fifty villages
and hamlets, parks, plantations and groves, all looking &ldquo;like
emeralds chased in gold.&rdquo;&nbsp; On the whole, I am inclined to
think many tourists would regard this view as even superior to that
of Belvoir Vale.&nbsp; It might be justly placed between that and Wharf
Vale.</p>
<p>A London gentleman produced a most unique picture on the forehead
of one of these hills, which may be seen at a great distance.&nbsp;
In the first place, he had a smooth, lawn-like surface prepared on the
steep slope.&nbsp; Then he cut out the form of a horse in the green
turf, sowing the whole contour of the animal with lime.&nbsp; This brought
out in such bold relief the body and limbs, that, at several miles distance,
you seem to see a colossal white horse standing on his four legs, perfect
in form and feature, even to ear and nostril.&nbsp; The symmetry is
perfect, although the body, head, legs and tail cover a space of <i>four</i>
acres!</p>
<p>The next day I took staff for Northallerton, reaching that town about
the middle of the afternoon.&nbsp; Passed through a highly cultivated
district, and saw, for the first time, several reaping machines at work
in the fields.&nbsp; I was struck at the manner in which they were used.&nbsp;
I have noticed a peculiarity in reaping in this section which must appear
singular to an American.&nbsp; The men cut inward instead of outward,
as with us.&nbsp; And these machines were following the same rule!&nbsp;
As they went around the field, they were followed or rather met by men
and women, each with an allotted beat, who rushed in behind and gathered
up the fallen from the standing grain so as to make a clear path for
the next round.&nbsp; There seemed to be no reason for this singular
and awkward practice, except the adhesion to an old custom of reaping.&nbsp;
The grain was not very stout, nor was it lodged.</p>
<p>From Northallerton I hastened on to Newcastle-upon-Tyne in order
to attend, for the first time in my life, the meetings of the British
Association.&nbsp; I reached that town on the 25th of August, and remained
there a week, enjoying one of the greatest treats that ever fell to
my lot.&nbsp; I will reserve a brief description of it for a separate
chapter at the end of this volume, if my Notes on other matters do not
crowd it out.</p>

FARM STEDDINGS&mdash;SCENERY OF THE TWEED VALLEY&mdash;EDINBURGH AND
ITS CHARACTERISTICS.</i></p>
<p>On Thursday, Sept. 3rd, I left Newcastle, and proceeded first westward
to the old town of Hexham, with the view of taking a more central route
into Scotland.&nbsp; Here, too, are the ruins of one of the most ancient
of the abbeys.&nbsp; The parish church wears the wrinkles of as many
centuries as the oldest in the land.&nbsp; Indeed, the town is full
of antiquities of different dates and races,&mdash;Roman, Scotch, Saxon,
Danish and Norman.&nbsp; They all left the marks of their glaived hands
upon it.</p>
<p>From Hexham I faced northward and followed the North Tyne up through
a very picturesque and romantic valley, thickly wooded and studded with
baronial mansions, parks, castles and residences of gentry, with comfortable
farm-houses looking sunny and cheerful on the green hill slopes and
on the quiet banks of the river.&nbsp; I saw fields of wheat quite green,
looking as if they needed another month&rsquo;s sun to fit them for
harvesting.&nbsp; Lodged in a little village about eight miles from
Hexham.&nbsp; The next day walked on to the little hamlet of Fallstones,
a distance of about twenty miles.&nbsp; As I ascended the valley, the
scene changed rapidly.&nbsp; The river dwindled to a narrow stream.&nbsp;
The hills that walled it in on either side grew higher and balder, and
the clouds lay cold and dank upon their bleak and sullen brows.&nbsp;
The hamlets edged in here and there grew thinner, smaller and shabbier.&nbsp;
The road was barred and gated about once in a mile, to keep cattle and
sheep from wandering; there being no fences nor hedges running parallel
with it.&nbsp; In a word, the premonitory symptoms of a bare border-land
thickened at every turn.</p>
<p>Another day brought me into the midst of a wild region, which might
be called No-man&rsquo;s-land; although most of it belongs to the Duke
of Northumberland.&nbsp; It is all in the solitary grandeur of heather-haired
hills, which tinge, with their purple flush, the huge, black-winged
clouds that alight upon them.&nbsp; Only here and there a shepherd&rsquo;s
cottage is to be seen half way up the heights, or sheltering itself
in a clump of trees in glen or gorge, like a benighted traveller bivouacking
for a night in a desert.&nbsp; Sheep, of the Cheviot breed mostly, are
nearly the sole inhabitants and industrials of this mountainous waste.&nbsp;
They climb to the highest peaks and bring down the white wealth of their
wool to man.&nbsp; It was pleasant to see them like walking mites, flecking
the dark brows of the mountains.&nbsp; They made a picture; they made
a <i>tableau vivant</i> of the same illustration as Landseer&rsquo;s
lamb looking into the grass-covered cannon&rsquo;s mouth.</p>
<p>This is the Border-land!&nbsp; Here the fiercest antagonisms of hostile
nationalities met in deadly conflict.&nbsp; Fire and blood, rapine and
wrath blackened and reddened and ravaged for centuries across this bleak
territory.&nbsp; Robber-chieftains and knighted free-booters carried
on their guerilla raids backward and forward, under the counterfeited
banner of patriotism.&nbsp; Scotch and English armies led by kings marched
and counter-marched over this sombre boundary.&nbsp; Never before was
there one apparently more insoluble as a barrier between two peoples.&nbsp;
Never before in Christendom was there one that required a longer space
of time to melt.&nbsp; Never before did the fusing of two nationalities
encounter more fierce and prolonged opposition.&nbsp; Did ever patriotism
pour out a swifter and deeper tide of chivalrous sentiment against merging
one in another?&mdash;against uniting two thrones and two peoples in
one?&nbsp; Did patriotism ever fight bloodier battles to prevent such
a union, or cling to local sovereignty with a more desperate hold?</p>
<p>This is the Border-land!&nbsp; Look up the purpled steeps of these
heathered hills.&nbsp; The white lambs are looking, with their soft,
meek eyes, into the grass-choked mouths of the rusty and dismantled
cannon of the war of nationalities between England and Scotland.&nbsp;
The deed has been consummated.&nbsp; The valor and patriotism of Wallace
and Bruce could not prevent it.&nbsp; The sheep of English and Scotch
shepherds feed side by side on these mountain heights, in spite of Stirling
and Bannockburn, of Flodden and Falkirk.&nbsp; The Iron Horse, bearing
the blended arms of the two realms on his shield, walks over those battle-fields
by night and day, treading their memories deeper and deeper in the dust.&nbsp;
The lambs are playing in the sun on the boundary line of the two dominions.&nbsp;
Does a Scot of to-day love his native land less than the Campbell clansman
or clan-chief in Bruce&rsquo;s time?&nbsp; Not a whit.&nbsp; He carries
a heartful of its choicest memories with him into all countries of his
sojourning.&nbsp; But there is a larger sentiment that includes all
these filial feelings towards his motherland, while it draws additional
warmth and strength from them.&nbsp; It is the sentiment of Imperial
Nationality; the feeling of a Briton, that does not extinguish nor absorb,
nor compete with, the Scot in his heart;&mdash;the feeling that he is
a political constituent of a mighty nation, whose feet stand upon all
the continents of the earth, while it holds the best islands of the
sea in its hands;&mdash;the feeling with which he says <i>We</i> with
all the millions of a dominion on which the sun never sets, and <i>Our</i>,
when he speaks of its grand and common histories, its hopes, prospects,
progress, power and aspirations.</p>
<p>There was a Border-land, dark and bloody, between Saxon England and
Celtic Wales.&nbsp; For centuries the red foot-marks of savage conflict
scarred and covered its wild waste.&nbsp; Never before did so small
a people make so stout, and desperate and protracted struggle for local
independence and isolation.&nbsp; Never did one produce a more strong-hearted
and blind-eyed patriotism, or patriotism more poets to thrill the listeners
to their lays with the intoxicating fanaticism of a national sentiment.&nbsp;
On that Border-land the white lambs now lie in the sun.&nbsp; The Welsh
sentiment is as strong as ever in the Snowdon shepherd, and he may not
speak a dozen words of the English tongue.&nbsp; But the Briton lives
in his breast.&nbsp; The feeling of its great meaning surrounds and
illumines the inner circles of his local attachment.&nbsp; He may never
have seen a map of the Globe, and never have been outside the wall of
the Welsh mountains; but he knows, without geography, who and what Queen
Victoria is among the earth&rsquo;s sovereigns, and the length and breadth
of her sceptre&rsquo;s reach and rule around the world.</p>
<p>There was a Border-land between Britain and Ireland, blackened and
scarred by more burning antagonisms than those that once divided the
larger island.&nbsp; The record of several consecutive centuries is
graven deep in it by the brand and bayonet, and by the more incisive
teeth-marks of hate.&nbsp; The slumbering antipathies of race and religion
even now crop out here and there, over the unfused boundary, in hissing
tongues of flame.&nbsp; The Briton and the Celt are still struggling
for the precedence in the Irishman&rsquo;s breast; but it is not a war
of extermination.&nbsp; His ardent nature is given to martial memories,
and all the battles he boasts of are British battles, in which he or
his father played the hero number one.&nbsp; The history of independent
Ireland is poor and thin; still he holds it back in his heart, and hesitates
to link it with the great annals of the &ldquo;Saxon&rdquo; realm, and
thus make of both one grand and glorious record, present and future.&nbsp;
He cannot yet make up his mind to say <i>We</i> with all the other English-speaking
millions of the empire, as the Scotsman and Welshman have learned and
loved to say it.&nbsp; He cannot as yet say <i>Our</i> with them with
such a sentiment of joint-interest, when the histories, hopes, expansion
and capacities of that empire unroll their vista before him.&nbsp; But
the rains and the dews of a milder century are falling upon this Border-land.&nbsp;
The lava of spent volcanoes that covered it is taking soil and seed
of green vegetation.&nbsp; The white lambs shall yet lie on it in the
sun.</p>
<p>What a volume might be filled with the succinctest history of the
Border-lands of Christendom!&nbsp; France was intersected with them
for centuries.&nbsp; Seemingly they were as implacable and obdurate
as any that ever divided the British isle.&nbsp; Local patriotism wrote
poetry and shed blood voluminously to prevent the fusion of these old
landmarks of pigmy nationalities.&nbsp; It took nearly a thousand years
to complete the blending; to make the <i>we</i> and the <i>our</i> of
one great consolidated empire the largest political sentiment of the
men of Normandy, Burgundy or Navarre.&nbsp; Long and fierce, and seemingly
endless was the struggle; but at last, on all those old obstinate boundaries
of hostile principalities, the white lambs lay in the sun.</p>
<p>There are Border-lands now in the south and east of Europe foaming
and seething with the same antagonisms of race and language; and Christendom
is tremulous with their emotion.&nbsp; It is the same old struggle over
again; and yet ninety-nine in a hundred of intelligent and reading people,
with the history of British and French Border-lands before them, seem
to think that a new and strange thing has happened under the sun.&nbsp;
Full that proportion of our English-speaking race, in both hemispheres,
closing the volume of its own annals, have made up their minds to the
belief that these Border-lands between German and Magyar, Teuton and
Latin, Russ and Pole, bristle with antagonisms the like of which never
were subdued, and never ought to be subdued by human means or motives.&nbsp;
To them, naturally, the half century of this hissing and seething, insurrection
and repression, is longer than the five hundred years and more it took
to fuse into one the nationalities of England and Wales.&nbsp; What
a point of space is a century midway between the ninth and nineteenth!&nbsp;
Few are long-sighted enough in historic vision to touch that point with
a cambric needle.&nbsp; It may seem unfeeling to say it or think it;
still it is as true as the plainest history of the last millenium.&nbsp;
There is a patriotism that looks at the future through a gimlet hole,
and sees in it but a single star.&nbsp; That patriotism is a natural,
and most popular sentiment.&nbsp; It was strong in the Welshman&rsquo;s
breast a thousand years ago, and in the Scotsman&rsquo;s half that distance
back in the past.&nbsp; But it is a patriotism that has its day and
its rule; then both its eyes are opened, and it looks upon the firmament
of the future broadside on, and sees a constellation where it once saw
and half worshipped a solitary star.&nbsp; Better to be the part of
a great WHOLE than the whole of a little <i>nothing</i>.</p>
<p>These continental Border-lands may see the face of their future history
in the mirror of England&rsquo;s annals.&nbsp; They are quaking now
with the impetuous emotions of local nationality.&nbsp; They are blackened
and scarred in the contest for the Welsh and Scotch independence of
centuries agone.&nbsp; But over those boundary wastes the grass shall
yet grow soft, fair and green, and there, too, the white lambs shall
lie in the sun.</p>
<p>My walk lay over the most inhospitable and unpeopled section I ever
saw.&nbsp; Calling at a station on the railway that passes through it,
I was told by the master that the nearest church or chapel was sixteen
miles in one direction, and over twenty in another.&nbsp; It is doubtful
if so large a churchless space could be found in Iowa or even Kansas.&nbsp;
I was glad to reach Hawick, a good, solid town but a little way inside
of the Scottish border, where I spent the sabbath and the following
Monday.&nbsp; This was a rallying and sallying point in the old Border
Wars, and was inundated two or three times by the flux and reflux of
this conflict, having been burnt twice, and put under the ordeal of
other calamities brought upon it when free-booting was both the business,
occupation and pastime of knighted chieftains and their clansmen.&nbsp;
It is now a thrifty, manufacturing town, lying in the trough of the
sea, or of the lofty hills that resemble waves hardened to earth in
their crests.&nbsp; Just opposite the Temperance Inn in which I had
my quarters, was the Tower Hotel, once a palatial mansion of the Buccleuchs.&nbsp;
There the Duchess of Monmouth used to hold her drawing-rooms in an apartment
which many a New England journeyman mechanic would hardly think ample
and comfortable enough for his parlor.&nbsp; There is a curious conical
mound in the town, called the Moat-hill, which looks like a great, green
carbuncle.&nbsp; It is thought by some to be a Druidical monument, but
is quite involved in a mystery which no one has satisfactorily solved.&nbsp;
It is strange that no persistent and successful effort has been made
to let day-light through it.&nbsp; Some workmen a long time ago undertook
to perforate it, but were frightened away by a thunder-storm, which
they seemed to take as a reproof and threatened punishment for their
profanity.&nbsp; The great business of Hawick is the manufacture of
a woollen fabric called <i>Tweeds</i>.&nbsp; It came to this name in
a singular way.&nbsp; The clerk of the factory made out an invoice of
the first lot to a London house under the name of <i>Twilled</i> goods.&nbsp;
The London man read it <i>Tweeds</i>, instead of Twilled, and ever since
they have gone by that title.&nbsp; As Sir Walter Scott was at that
time making the name &ldquo;Tweed&rdquo; illustrious, the mistake was
a very lucrative one to the manufacturers of the article.&nbsp; Here,
too, in this border town commences the chain of birthplaces of eminent
men, who have honored Scotland with their lives and history.&nbsp; Here
was born James Wilson, once the editor of <i>The Economist</i>, who
worked his way up, through intermediate positions of public honor and
trust, to that of Finance Minister for India, and died at the meridian
of his manhood in that country of dearly-bought distinctions.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Sept. 8th, I commenced my walk northward from this threshold
town of Scotland.&nbsp; Followed down the Teviot to Denholm, the birth-place
of the celebrated poet and linguist, Dr. John Leyden, another victim
who offered himself a sacrifice to the costly honors and emoluments
of East Indian official life.&nbsp; One great thought fired his soul
in all the perils and privations of that deadly climate.&nbsp; It was
to ascend one niche higher in knowledge of oriental tongues than Sir
William Jones.&nbsp; He labored to this end with a desperate assiduity
that perhaps was never surpassed or even equalled.&nbsp; He died hugging
the conviction that he had attained it.&nbsp; This little village was
his birthplace.&nbsp; Here he wrote his first rhymes, and wooed and
won the first inspirations of the muse.&nbsp; His heart, as its last
pulses grew weaker and slower, in that far-off heathen land, took on
its child-thoughts again and its child-memories; and his last words
were about this little, rural hamlet where he was born.&nbsp; A beautiful
monument has been erected to his memory in the centre of the large common
around which the village is built.&nbsp; On each of the four sides of
the monument there is a tribute to his name and worth; one from Sir
Walter Scott, and one taken from his own poems, entitled &ldquo;Scenes
of my Infancy,&rdquo; a touching appeal to his old friends and neighbors
to hold him in kind remembrance.</p>
<p>All this section is as fertile as it can be in the sceneries and
historical associations favorable for inspiring a strong-hearted love
of country, and for the development of the poetry of romantic patriotism.&nbsp;
It was pleasant to emerge from the dark, cold, barren border-land, from
the uncivilized mountains, standing sullen in the wild, shaggy <i>chevelure</i>
of nature, and to walk again between towering hills dressed in the best
toilet of human industry, crowned with golden wheatfields, and zoned
with broad girdles of the greenest vegetation.&nbsp; It is when these
contrasts are suddenly and closely brought within the same vista that
one sees and feels how the Creator has honored the labor of human hands,
and lifted it up into partnership with His omnipotences in chronicling
the consecutive centuries of the earth in illuminated capitals of this
joint handwriting.&nbsp; It is a grand and impressive sight&mdash;one
of those dark-browed hills of the Border-land, bearded to its rock-ridged
forehead with such bush-bristles and haired with matted heather.&nbsp;
In nature it is what a painted Indian squaw in her blanket, eagle feathers
and moccasins, is in the world of humanity.&nbsp; We look upon both
with a species of admiration, as contrasts with objects whose worth
is measured by the comparison.&nbsp; The Empress Eugenie and the Princess
of Wales, and wives and sisters lovelier still to the circles of humble
life, look more beautiful and graceful when the eye turns to them from
a glance at the best-looking squaw of the North American wilds.&nbsp;
And so looked the well-dressed hills on each side of the Teviot, compared
with the uncultured and stunted mountains among which I had so recently
walked.</p>
<p>Ascending from Teviotdale, I passed the Earl of Minto&rsquo;s seat,
a large and modern-looking mansion, surrounded with beautiful grounds
and noble trees, and commanding a grand and picturesque view of valley
and mountain from an excellent point of observation.&nbsp; As soon as
I lost sight of Teviotdale another grand vista of golden and purpled
hills and rich valleys burst upon my sight as suddenly as theatrical
sceneries are shifted on the stage.&nbsp; Dined in a little, rural,
unpoetical village bearing the name of Lilliesleaf.&nbsp; Resuming my
walk, I soon came in sight of the grand valley of the Tweed, a great
basin of natural beauty, holding, as it were, Scotland&rsquo;s &ldquo;apples
of gold in pictures of silver.&rdquo;&nbsp; Every step commanded some
new feature of interest.&nbsp; Here on the left arose to the still,
blue bosom of the sky the three great Eildon Hills, with their heads
crowned with heather as with an emerald diadem.&nbsp; The sun is low,
and the far-off village in the valley shows dimly between the daylight
and darkness.&nbsp; There is the shadow of a broken edifice, broken
but grand, that arises out of the midst of the low houses.&nbsp; A little
farther on, arches, and the stone vein-work of glassless windows, and
ivy-netted towers come out more distinctly.&nbsp; I recognise them at
the next furlong.&nbsp; They stand thus in pictures hung up in the parlors
of thousands of common homes in America, Australia and India.&nbsp;
They are the ruins of Melrose Abbey.&nbsp; Here is the original of the
picture.&nbsp; I see it at last, as thousands of Americans have seen
it before.&nbsp; In history and association it is to them the Westminster
Abbey of Scotland, but in ruin.&nbsp; It looks natural, though not at
first glance what one expected.&nbsp; The familiar engraving does not
give us the real flesh and blood of the antiquity, or the complexion
of the stone; but it does not exaggerate the exquisite symmetries and
artistic genius of the structure.&nbsp; These truly inspire one with
wonder.&nbsp; They are all that pen and pencil have described them.&nbsp;
The great window, which is the most salient feature in the common picture,
is a magnificent piece of work in stone, twenty-four feet in height
and sixteen in breadth.&nbsp; It is all in the elm-tree order of architecture.&nbsp;
The old monks belonged to that school, and they wrought out branches,
leaves and leaf-veins, and framed the lacework of their chisels with
colored glass most exquisitely.</p>
<p>Melrose Abbey was the eldest daughter, I believe, of Rievaulx Abbey,
in Yorkshire, which has already been noticed; a year or two older in
its foundation than Fountain Abbey, in Studley Park.&nbsp; The fecundity
with which these ecclesiastical buildings multiplied and replenished
England and Scotland is a marvel, considering the age in which they
were erected and the small population and the poverty of the country.&nbsp;
But something on this aspect of the subject hereafter.&nbsp; Here lie
the ashes of Scottish kings, abbots and knights whose names figured
conspicuously in the history of public and private wars which cover
such a space of the country&rsquo;s life as an independent nation.&nbsp;
The Douglas family especially with several of its branches found a resting-place
for their dust within these walls.&nbsp; Built and rebuilt, burnt and
reburnt, mutilated, dismembered, consecrated and desecrated, make up
the history of this celebrated edifice, and that of its like, from Land&rsquo;s
End to John O&rsquo;Groat&rsquo;s.&nbsp; It is a slight but a very appreciable
mitigation of these destructive acts that it was ruined <i>artistically</i>;
just as some enthusiastic castle and abbey-painter would have suggested.</p>
<p>Although I spent the night at Melrose, it was a dark and cloudy one,
so that I could not see the abbey by moonlight&mdash;a view so much
prized and celebrated.&nbsp; The next day I literally walked from morning
till evening among the tombstones of antiquity and monuments of Scotch
history invested with an interest which will never wane.&nbsp; In the
first place, I went down the Tweed a few miles and crossed it in a ferry-boat
to see Dryburgh Abbey.&nbsp; Here, embowered among the trees in a silver
curve of the river, stands this grand monument of one of the most remarkable
ages of the world.&nbsp; Within an hour&rsquo;s walk from Melrose, and
four or five years only after the completion of that edifice, the foundations
of this were laid.&nbsp; It is astonishing.&nbsp; We will not dwell
upon it now, but make a separate chapter on it when I have seen most
of the other ruins of the kind in the kingdom.&nbsp; The French are
given to the habit of festooning the monuments and graves of their relatives
and friends with <i>immortelles</i>.&nbsp; Nature has hung one of hers
to Dryburgh Abbey.&nbsp; It is a yew-tree opposite the door by which
you enter the ruins.&nbsp; The year-rings of its trunk register all
the centuries that the stones of the oldest wall have stood imbedded
one upon the other.&nbsp; The tree is still green, putting forth its
leaf in its season.&nbsp; But there is an <i>immortelle</i> hung to
these dark, crumbling walls that shall outlive the greenest trees now
growing on earth.&nbsp; Here, in a little vaulted chapel, or rather
a deep niche in the wall, lie the remains of Sir Walter Scott, his wife
and the brilliant Lockhart.&nbsp; How many thousands of all lands where
the English language is spoken will come and stand here in mute and
pensive communion before the iron gate of this family tomb and look
through the bars upon this group of simply-lettered stones!</p>
<p>From Dryburgh I walked back to Melrose on the east side of the Tweed.&nbsp;
Lost the footpath, and for two hours clambered up and down the precipitous
cliffs that rise high and abrupt from the river.&nbsp; In many places
the zig-zag path was cut into the rock, hardly a foot in breadth, overhanging
a precipice which a person of weak nerves could hardly face with composure.&nbsp;
At last got out of these dark fastnesses and ascended a range of lofty
hills where I found a good carriage road.&nbsp; This elevation commanded
the most magnificent view that I ever saw in Scotland, excepting, perhaps,
the one from Stirling Castle only for the feature which the Forth supplies.&nbsp;
It was truly beautiful beyond description, and it would be useless for
me to attempt one.</p>
<p>After dinner in Melrose, I resumed my walk northward and came suddenly
upon Abbotsford.&nbsp; Indeed, I should have missed it, had I not noticed
a wooden gate open on the roadside, with some directions upon it for
those wishing to visit the house.&nbsp; As it stands low down towards
the river, and as all the space above it to the road is covered with
trees and shrubbery, it is entirely hidden from view in that direction.&nbsp;
The descent to the house is rather steep and long.&nbsp; And here it
is!&mdash;Abbotsford!&nbsp; It is the photograph of Sir Walter Scott.&nbsp;
It is brim full of him and his histories.&nbsp; No author&rsquo;s pen
ever gave such an individuality to a human home.&nbsp; It is all the
coinage of thoughts that have flooded the hemispheres.&nbsp; Pages of
living literature built up all these lofty walls, bent these arches,
panelled these ceilings, and filled the whole edifice with these mementoes
of the men and ages gone.&nbsp; Every one of these hewn stones cost
a paragraph; that carved and gilded crest, a column&rsquo;s length of
thinking done on paper.&nbsp; It must be true that pure, unaided literary
labor never built before a mansion of this magnitude and filled it with
such treasures of art and history.&nbsp; This will forever make it and
the pictures of it a monument of peculiar interest.&nbsp; I have said
that it is brim full of the author.&nbsp; It is equally full of all
he wrote about; full of the interesting topographs of Scotland&rsquo;s
history, back to the twilight ages; full inside and out, and in the
very garden and stable walls.&nbsp; The studio of an artist was never
fuller of models of human or animal heads, or of counterfeit duplicates
of Nature&rsquo;s handiwork, than Sir Walter&rsquo;s mansion is of things
his pen painted on in the long life of its inspirations.&nbsp; The very
porchway that leads into the house is hung with petrified stag-horns,
doubtless dug up in Scottish bogs, and illustrating a page of the natural
history of the country in some pre-historic century.&nbsp; The halls
are panelled with Scotland,&mdash;with carvings in oak from the old
palace of Dunfermline.&nbsp; Coats of arms of the celebrated Border
chieftains are arrayed in line around the walls.&nbsp; The armoury is
a miniature arsenal of all arms ever wielded since the time of the Druids.&nbsp;
And a history attaches to nearly every one of the weapons.&nbsp; History
hangs its webwork everywhere.&nbsp; It is built, high and low, into
the face of the outside walls.&nbsp; Quaint, old, carved stones from
abbey and castle ruins, arms, devices and inscriptions are all here
presented to the eye like the printed page of an open volume.&nbsp;
Among the interesting relics are a chair made from the rafters of the
house in which Wallace was betrayed, Rob Roy&rsquo;s pistol, and the
key of the old Tolbooth of Edinburgh.</p>
<p>I was conducted through the rooms opened to visitors by a very gentlemanly-looking
man, who might be taken for an author himself, from his intellectual
appearance and conversation.&nbsp; The library is the largest of all
the apartments&mdash;fifty feet by sixty.&nbsp; Nor is it too large
for the collection of books it contains, which numbers about 20,000
volumes, many of them very rare and valuable.&nbsp; But the soul-centre
of the building to me was the <i>study</i>, opening into the library.&nbsp;
There is the small writing-table, and there is the plain armchair in
which he sat by it and worked out those creations of fancy which have
excited such interest through the world.&nbsp; That square foot over
against this chair, where his paper lay, is the focus, the point of
incidence and reflection, of thoughts that pencilled outward, like sun-rays,
until their illumination reached the antipodes,&mdash;thoughts that
brought a pleasant shining to the sun-burnt face of the Australian shepherd
as he watched his flock at noon from under the shadow of a stunted tree;
thoughts which made a cheery fellowship at night for the Hudson Bay
hunter, in his snow-buried cabin on the Saskatchiwine.&nbsp; The books
of this little inner library were the body-guard of his genius, chosen
to be nearest him in the outsallyings of his imagination.&nbsp; Here
is a little conversational closet, with a window in it to let in the
leaf-sifted light and air&mdash;a small recess large enough for a couple
of chairs or so, which he called a &ldquo;<i>Speak-a-bit</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Here is something so near his personality that it almost startles you
like a sudden apparition of himself.&nbsp; It is a glass case containing
the clothes he last wore on earth,&mdash;the large-buttoned, blue coat,
the plaid trousers, the broad-brimmed hat, and heavy, thick-soled shoes
which he had on when he came in from his last walk to lay himself down
and die.</p>
<p>On signing my name in the register, I was affected at a coincidence
which conveyed a tribute of respect to the memory of the great author
of striking significance, while it recorded the painful catastrophe
which has broken over upon the American Republic.&nbsp; It was a sad
sight to me to see the profane and suicidal antagonisms which have rent
it in twain brought to the shrine of this great memory and graven upon
its sacred tablet as it were with the murdering dagger&rsquo;s point.&nbsp;
New and bad initials!&nbsp; The father and patriot Washington would
have wept tears of blood to have read them here,&mdash;to have read
them anywhere, bearing such deplorable meaning.&nbsp; They were U.S.A.
and C.S.A., as it were chasing each other up and down the pages of the
visitors&rsquo; register.&nbsp; Sad, sad was the sight&mdash;sadder,
in a certain sense, than the smoke-wreaths of the Tuscarora and Alabama
ploughing the broad ocean with their keels.&nbsp; U.S.A. and C.S.A.!&nbsp;
What initials for Americans to write, with the precious memories of
a common history and a common weal still held to their hearts&mdash;to
write here or anywhere!&nbsp; What a riving and a ruin do those letters
record!&nbsp; Still they brought in their severed hands a common homage-gift
to the memory of the Writer of Abbotsford.&nbsp; If they represented
the dissolution of a great political fabric, in which they once gloried
with equal pride, they meant union here&mdash;a oneness indissoluble
in admiration for a great genius whose memory can no more be localised
to a nation than the interest of his works.</p>
<p>American names, both of the North and South, may be found on almost
every page of the register.&nbsp; I wrote mine next to that of a gentleman
from Worcester, Mass., my old place of residence, who only left an hour
before my arrival.&nbsp; Abbotsford and Stratford-upon-Avon are points
to which our countrymen converge in their travels in this country; and
you will find more of their signatures in the registry of these two
haloed homesteads of genius than anywhere else in Europe.</p>
<p>The valley of the Tweed in this section is all an artist would delight
in as a surrounding of such histories.&nbsp; The hills are lofty, declining
into gorges or dells at different angles with the river, which they
wall in precipitously with their wooded sides in many places.&nbsp;
They are mostly cultivated to the top, and now in harvest many of them
were crowned with stooked sheaves of wheat, each looking in the distance
like Nature with her golden curls done up in paper, dressing for the
harvest-home of the season.&nbsp; Some of them wore belts and gores
of turnip foliage of different <i>nuances</i> of green luxuriance, combining
with every conceivable shade and alternation of vegetable coloring.&nbsp;
Indeed, as already intimated, the view from the eminence almost overhanging
the little sequestered peninsula on which Old Melrose stood twelve centuries
ago, is indescribably beautiful, and well worth a long journey to see,
disconnected from its historical associations.&nbsp; The Eildon Hills
towering up heather-crowned to the height of over 1,300 feet above the
level of the sea right out of the sheen of barley fields, as from a
sea of silver, form one of the salient features of this glorious landscape.&nbsp;
This is an interesting peculiarity of Scotch scenery;&mdash;civilization
sapping the barbarism of the wilderness; wheat-fields <i>mordant</i>
biting in upon peaty moorlands, or climbing to the tops of cold, bald
mountains, shearing off their thorny locks of heather and covering them
with the well-dressed <i>chevelure</i> of yellow grain.&nbsp; Where
the farmer&rsquo;s horse cannot climb with the plough, or the little
sheep cannot graze to advantage, human hands plant the Scotch larch
or fir, just as a tenant-gardener would set out cabbage-plants in odd
corners of his little holding which he could have no other use for.</p>
<p>Abbotsferry is just above Abbotsford, and is crossed in a small row-boat.&nbsp;
The river here is of considerable width and quite rapid.&nbsp; The boat
was kept on the other side; so I hallooed to a man engaged in thatching
a rick of oats to come and ferry me over.&nbsp; Without descending from
the ladder, he called to some one in the cottage, when, to my surprise,
a well-dressed young woman, in rather flowing dress, red jacket, and
with her hair tastefully done up in a net <i>a-la-mode</i>, made her
appearance.&nbsp; Descending to the river, she folded up her gown, and,
settling herself to the oars, &ldquo;pushed her light shallop from the
shore&rdquo; with the grace of The Lady of the Lake.&nbsp; In a few
minutes she ran the prow upon the pebbled beach at my feet, and I took
my seat at the other end of the boat.&nbsp; She did it all so naturally,
and without any other flush upon her pleasant face than that of the
exercise of rowing, that I felt quite easy myself and checked the expression
of regret I was on the point of uttering for putting her to such service.&nbsp;
A few questions convinced me it was her regular employment, especially
when her father was busy.&nbsp; I could not help asking her if she had
ever read &ldquo;The Lady of the Lake,&rdquo; but found that neither
that romance nor any other had ever invested her river experience with
any sensibility except of a cheerful duty.&nbsp; She was going to do
the whole for a penny, her usual charge, but I declined to take back
any change for the piece of silver I gave to her, intimating that I
regarded it cheap at that to be rowed over a river by such hands.</p>
<p>Almost opposite to Abbotsford I passed one of the best farming establishments
I had seen in Scotland.&nbsp; I was particularly struck with a feature
which will hereafter distinguish the steddings or farm buildings in
Great Britain.&nbsp; Steam has already accomplished many changes, and
among others one that could hardly have been anticipated when it was
first applied to common uses.&nbsp; It has virtually turned the threshing-floor
out of doors.&nbsp; Grain growing has become completely out-of-door
work, from seeding to sending to market.&nbsp; The day of building two-story
barns for storing and threshing wheat, barley and oats is over, I am
persuaded, in this country.&nbsp; A quadrangle of slate-roofed cow-sheds,
for housing horses and cattle, will displace the old-fashioned barns,
each with its rood of roof.&nbsp; This I saw on crossing the Tweed was
quite new, and may serve as a model of the housing that will come into
vogue rapidly.&nbsp; One familiar with New England in the &ldquo;old
meeting-house&rdquo; time would call this establishment a hollow square
of horse-sheds, without a break or crevice at the angles.</p>
<p>I reached Galashiels about 5 p.m., and stopped an hour for tea.&nbsp;
This is a vigorous and thrifty town, that makes a profitable and useful
business of the manufacture of tweeds, tartans and shawls.&nbsp; It
is situated on the banks of the Gala, a little, rapid, shallow river
that joins the Tweed about a mile below.&nbsp; After tea I resumed my
walk, but owing to the confused direction of the landlady, took the
wrong side of the river, and diverged westward toward Peebles.&nbsp;
I had made three miles or more in this direction before I found out
my mistake, so was obliged to return to Galashiels, where I concluded
to spend the night, after another involuntary excursion more unsatisfactory
than my walk around Sheffield, inasmuch as I had to travel over the
same road twice for the whole distance.&nbsp; Thus the three mistakes
thus far made have cost me twenty miles of extra footing.&nbsp; The
next morning I set out in good season, determined to reach Edinburgh,
if possible, by night.</p>
<p>Followed the Gala Water, as it is called here, just as if it were
a placid lake or land-locked bay, though it is a tortuous and swift-running
stream.&nbsp; The scenery was still picturesque, in some places very
grand and romantic.&nbsp; There was one great amphitheatre just before
reaching the village of Stow which was peculiarly interesting.&nbsp;
It was a great bowl full of earth&rsquo;s glory up to the very rim.&nbsp;
The circular wall was embossed with the best patterns and colors of
vegetation.&nbsp; The hills of every <i>tournure</i> showed each in
a fir setting, looking, with their sloping fields of grain, like inverted
goblets of gold vined with emerald leafwork.&nbsp; In the valley a reaping
machine was at work with its peculiar chatter and clatter, and men and
women were following in its wake, gathering up and binding the grain
as it fell and clearing the way for the next round.&nbsp; Up and down
these hills frequently runs a stripe of Scotch firs or larches a few
rods wide; here and there they resemble those geometrical figures often
seen in gardens and pleasure grounds.&nbsp; The sun peeping out of the
clouds, and flooding these features with a sudden, transient river of
light, gives them a glow and glory that would delight the artist.&nbsp;
After a long walk through such scenery, I reached, late in the evening,
<i>Auld Reekie</i>, a favorite home-name which the modern Athenians
love to give to Edinburgh.&nbsp; Being anxious to push on and complete
my journey as soon as practicable, I only remained in the celebrated
Scotch metropolis one night, taking staff early next morning, and holding
northward towards the Highlands.</p>
<p>Edinburgh has made its mark upon the world and its place among the
great centres of the world&rsquo;s civilization.&nbsp; On the whole,
no city in Great Britain, or in Christendom, has ever attained to such
well-developed, I will not say angular, but salient individuality.&nbsp;
This is deep-featured and ineffaceable.&nbsp; It is, not was.&nbsp;
Edinburgh has reared great men prolifically and supplied the world with
them, and kept always a good number back for itself to give a shaping
to others the world needed.&nbsp; Its prestige is great in the production
of such intellects.&nbsp; But it keeps up with the times.&nbsp; It is
faithful to its antecedents, and appreciates them at their full value
and obligation.&nbsp; It does not lie a-bed until noon because it has
got its name up for educating brilliant minds.&nbsp; Its grand old University
holds its own among the wranglers of learning.&nbsp; Its High School
is proportionately as high as ever, notwithstanding the rapid growth
of others of the same purpose.&nbsp; Its pulpit boasts of its old mind-power
and moral stature.&nbsp; Its Theology stands iron-cabled, grand and
solid as an iceberg in the sea of modern speculation, unsoftened under
the patter of the heterodox sentimentalities of human philanthropy.&nbsp;
It is growing more and more a City of Palaces.&nbsp; And the palaces
are all built for housing the poorest of the poor, the weakest of the
weak and the vilest of the vile.&nbsp; These hospitals are the Holyroods
of Edinburgh II.&nbsp; They honor it with a renown better than the royal
palace of the latter name ever won.</p>
<p>I said Edinburgh the Second.&nbsp; That is correct.&nbsp; There are
two towns, the Old and the New; the last about half a century&rsquo;s
age.&nbsp; But the oldest will be the youngest fifty years hence.&nbsp;
The hand of a &ldquo;higher civilization,&rdquo; with its spirit-level,
pick, plane and trowel, is upon it with the grip of a Samson.&nbsp;
That hand will tone down its great distinctive individualities and give
it the modern <i>uniformity</i> of design, face and feature.&nbsp; All
these tall houses, built skyward layer upon layer or flat upon flat,
until they show half a dozen stories on one street, and twice that number
on the other, are doomed, and they will be done for, one by one in its
turn.&nbsp; They probably came in with Queen Mary, and they will go
out under the blue-eyed Alexandra.&nbsp; They will be supplanted by
the most improved architecture of modern taste and utilitarianism.&nbsp;
Edinburgh will be Anglicised and put in the fashionable costume of a
progressive age; in the same swallow-tailed coat, figured vest and stovepipe
hat worn by London, Liverpool and Manchester.&nbsp; It will not be allowed
to wear tweed pantaloons except for one circumstance;&mdash;that it
is now building its best houses of stone instead of brick.</p>
<p>But there are physical features that will always distinguish Edinburgh
from all other cities of the world and which no architectural changes
can ever obliterate or deface.&nbsp; There are Arthur&rsquo;s Seat,
Salisbury Crags, the Calton Hill, and the Castle Height, and there they
will stand forever&mdash;the grandest surroundings and garniture of
Nature ever given to any capital or centre of the earth&rsquo;s populations.</p>

IN A WAYSIDE COTTAGE&mdash;ARRIVAL AT INVERNESS.</i></p>
<p>On Friday, Sept. 11th, I left for the north the morning after my
arrival in Edinburgh, hoping to finish my long walk before the rainy
season commenced.&nbsp; My old friend and host accompanied me across
the Forth, by the Granton Ferry, and walked with me for some distance
on the other side; then bidding me God-speed, he returned to the city.&nbsp;
The weather was fine, and the farmers were very busy at work.&nbsp;
A vast quantity of grain, especially of oats, was cut and ready for
carting; but little of it had been ricked in consequence of frequent
showers.&nbsp; I noticed that they used a different snath for their
scythes here from that common in England.&nbsp; It is in two parts,
like the handles of a plough, joining a foot or two above the blade.&nbsp;
One is shorter than the other, each having a thole.&nbsp; It is a singular
contrivance, but seems to be preferred here to the old English pole.&nbsp;
I have never seen yet an American scythe-snath in England or Scotland,
although so much of our implemental machinery has been introduced.&nbsp;
American manure-forks and hay-forks, axes and augurs you will now find
exposed for sale in nearly every considerable town, but one of our beautifully
mounted scythes would be a great novelty here.</p>
<p>The scenery varies, but retains the peculiarly Scotch features.&nbsp;
Hills which we should call mountains are frequently planted with trees
as far up as the soil will lie upon the precipitous sides.&nbsp; On
passing one of great height, bald at the top, but bearded to the eyebrows
with fir and larch, I asked an elderly man, a blacksmith, standing in
his shop-door, if they were a natural growth.&nbsp; He said that he
and his two boys planted them all about forty-eight years ago.&nbsp;
They were now worth, on an average, twelve English shillings, or about
three dollars a-piece.</p>
<p>I lodged in Kinross, a pleasant-faced, quiet and comfortable little
town, done up with historical associations of special interest.&nbsp;
Here is Loch Leven, serene and placid, like a mirror framed with wooded
hills, looking at their faces in it.&nbsp; It is a beautiful sheet of
water, taking the history out of it.&nbsp; But putting that in and around
it, you see a picture before you that you will remember.&nbsp; Here
is more of Mary the Unfortunate.&nbsp; You see reflected in the silver
sheen of the lake that face which looks at you with its soft appeal
for sympathy in all the galleries of Christendom.&nbsp; Out there, on
that little islet, green and low, stands the black castle in which they
prisoned her.&nbsp; There they made her trembling, indignant fingers
write herself &ldquo;a queen without a crown.&rdquo;&nbsp; Southward
there, where amateurs now fish for trout, young Douglas rowed her ashore
with muffled oars so softly that they stirred no ripple at the bow.&nbsp;
The keys of the castle they threw into the lake to bar pursuit, lay
in the mud for nearly three centuries, when they were found by a lad
of the village, and presented to the Earl of Morton, a representative
of the Douglas family.</p>
<p>The next day I walked on to Perth, passing through a very interesting
section, which nature and history have enriched with landscapes and
manscapes manifold.&nbsp; It is truly a romantic region for both these
qualities, with delightful views in sudden and frequent alternation.&nbsp;
Glens deep, winding and dark, with steep mountain walls folding their
tree-hands over the road; lofty hills in full Scotch uniform, in tartan
heather and yellow grain plaided in various figures; chippering streams,
now hidden, now coming to the light, in white flashing foam in a rocky
glade of the dell; straths or savannas, like great prairie gardens,
threaded by meandering rivers and studded with wheat in sheaves, shocks
and ricks, seen over long reaches of unreapt harvests; villages, hamlets,
white cottages nestling in the niches and green gorges of the mountains,&mdash;and
all these sceneries set in romantic histories dating back to the Danes
and their doings in Scotland, make up a prevista for the eye and a revista
for the mind that keep both in exhilarating occupation every rod of
the distance from Kinross to Perth.</p>
<p>The road <i>via</i> Glenfarg would be a luxury of the first enjoyment
to any tourist with an eye to the wild, romantic and picturesque.&nbsp;
Debouching from this long, winding, tree-arched dell, you come out upon
Strathearn, or the bottom-land of the river Earn, which joins the Tay
a few miles below.&nbsp; The term strath is peculiarly a Scottish designation
which many American readers may not have fully comprehended, although
it is so blended with the history and romance of this country.&nbsp;
It is not a valley proper, as we use that term; as the Valley of the
Mississippi or the Valley of the Connecticut.&nbsp; If the word were
admissible, it might be called most descriptively the land-bay of a
river, at a certain distance between its source and mouth, such for
instance as the German Flats on the Mohawk, or the Oxbow on the Connecticut,
at Wethersfield, in Vermont, or the great onion-growing flat on the
same river at Wethersfield in Connecticut.&nbsp; These straths are numerous
in Scotland, and constitute the great productive centres of the mountain
sections.&nbsp; They are generally cultivated to the highest perfection
of agricultural science and economy and are devoted mostly to grain.&nbsp;
As they are always walled in by bald-headed mountains and lofty hills,
cropped as high as man and horse can climb with a plough and planted
with firs and larches beyond, they show beautifully to the eye, and
constitute, with these surroundings, the peculiar charm of Scotch scenery.&nbsp;
The term is always prefixed to the name of the river, as Strathearn,
Strathspey, etc.</p>
<p>I noticed on this day&rsquo;s walk the same singular habit that struck
me in the north part of Yorkshire; that is, of cutting inward upon the
standing grain.&nbsp; Several persons, frequently women and boys, follow
the mowers, and pick up the swath and bind it into sheaves, using no
rake at all in the process.&nbsp; So pertinaciously they seem to adhere
to this remarkable and awkward custom, that I saw two mowers walk down
a hill, a distance of full a hundred rods, with their scythes under
their arms, in order to begin a new swath in the same way; four or five
men and women running after them full tilt to bind the grain as it fell!&nbsp;
Here was a loss of at least five minutes each to half a dozen hands,
amounting to half an hour to a single man at the end of each swath or
work.&nbsp; Supposing the mowers made twenty in ten hours from bottom
to top of the field, here is the loss of one whole day for one man,
or one sixth of the whole aggregate time applied to the harvesting of
the crop, given to the mere running down that hill of six pairs of legs
for no earthly purpose but to cut inward instead of outward, as we do.&nbsp;
The grain-ricks in Scotland are nearly all round and quite small.&nbsp;
Every one of them is rounded up at the top and fitted with a Mandarin-looking
hat of straw, which sheds the rain well.&nbsp; A good-sized farm-house
is flanked with quite a village of these little round stacks, looking
like a comfortable colony of large, yellow tea-caddies in the distance.</p>
<p>Reached Perth a little after dark, having made a walk of nearly twenty
miles after 11 a.m.&nbsp; Here I remained over the Sabbath, and greatly
enjoyed both its rest and the devotional exercises in some of the churches
of the city.</p>
<p>The Fair City of Perth is truly most beautifully situated at the
head of navigation on the Tay, as Stirling is on the Forth.&nbsp; It
has no mountainous eminence in its midst, castle-crowned, like Stirling,
from which to look off upon such a scene as the latter commands.&nbsp;
But Nature has erected grand and lofty observatories near by in the
Moncrieffe and Kinnoull Hills, from which a splendid prospect is unrolled
to the eye.&nbsp; There is some historical or legendary authority for
the idea that the Romans contemplated this view from Moncrieffe Hill;
and, as the German army, returning homeward from France, shouted with
wild enthusiasm, at its first sight, <i>Der Rhein!&nbsp; Der Rhein</i>!
so these soldiers of the C&aelig;sars shouted at the view of the Tay
and the Corse of Gowrie, <i>Ecce Tiber!&nbsp; Ecce Compus Martius</i>!&nbsp;
There was more patriotism than parity in the comparison.&nbsp; The Italian
river is a Rhine in history, but a mere Goose Creek within its actual
banks compared with the Tay.&nbsp; In history, Perth has its full share
of &ldquo;love and murder,&rdquo; rhyme and romance, sieges, battering
and burning, royals and rebels.&nbsp; In the practical life of to-day,
it is a progressive, thriving town, busy, intelligent, respected and
honorable.&nbsp; The two natural features which would attract, perhaps,
the most special attention of the traveller are the two Inches, North
and South, divided by the city.&nbsp; This is a peculiar Scotch term
which an untravelled American will hardly understand.&nbsp; It has no
relation to measurement of any kind; but signifies what we should call
a low, level green or common in or adjoining a town.&nbsp; The Inches
of Perth are, to my eye, the finest in Scotland, each having about a
mile and a half in circumference, and making delightful and healthy
playgrounds and promenades for the whole population.</p>
<p>On Monday, Sept. 14th, I took staff and set out for another week-stage
of my walk, or from Perth to Inverness.&nbsp; Crossed the Tay and proceeded
northward up the east side of that fertile river.&nbsp; Fertile may
sound at first a singular qualification for a broad, rapid stream running
down out of the mountains and widening into a bay or firth at its mouth.&nbsp;
But it may be applied in the best sense of production to the Tay; and
not only that, but other terms known to practical agriculture.&nbsp;
Up to the present moment, no river in the world has been cultivated
with more science and success.&nbsp; None has been sown so thickly with
seed-vitalities or produced more valuable crops of aquatic life.&nbsp;
Here salmon are hatched by hand and folded and herded with a shepherd&rsquo;s
care.&nbsp; Here pisciculture, or, to use a far better and more euphonious
word, fish-farming, is carried to the highest perfection in Great Britain.&nbsp;
It is a tillage that must hereafter take its place with agriculture
as a great and honored industry.&nbsp; If the cold, bald-headed mountains,
the wild, stony reaches of poverty-stricken regions, moor, morass, steppe
and prairie are made the pasturage of sheep innumerable, the thousands
of rivers in both hemispheres will not be suffered to run to waste through
another century.&nbsp; The utilitarian genius of the present age will
turn them into pasturage worth more per acre than the value of the richest
land on their banks.&nbsp; Just think of the pasturage of the Tay.&nbsp;
It rents for &pound;14,000 a year; and those who hire it must make it
produce at least &pound;50,000, or $240,000 annually.&nbsp; Let us assume
that the whole length of this salmon-pasturage is fifty miles, and its
average width one-eighth of a mile.&nbsp; Then the whole distance would
contain the space of 4,000 square acres, and the annual rent for fishing
would amount to over &pound;3 13s. per acre.&nbsp; This would make every
fish-bearing acre of the river worth &pound;100, calculated on the land
basis of interest or rent.</p>
<p>Having heard of the Stormontfields&rsquo; Ponds for breeding salmon,
I had a great desire to see them.&nbsp; They are situated on the Tay,
a few miles above Perth, and are well worthy of the inspection and admiration
of the scientific as well as the utilitarian world.&nbsp; The process
is as simple as it is successful and valuable.&nbsp; A race or canal,
filled with a clear, mountain stream, and constructed many years ago
to supply motive power to a corn-mill, runs parallel with the river,
at the distance from it of about twenty rods.&nbsp; At right angles
with this stream, there are twenty-five wooden boxes side by side, about
fifty feet in length, placed on a slight decline.&nbsp; These boxes
or troughs, each about two feet wide and one foot deep, are divided
into partitions by cross-boards, which do not reach, within a few inches,
the top of the siding, so that the water shall make a continuous surface
the whole length of the trough.&nbsp; Each trough is filled with round
river stones or pebbles washed clean, on which the spawn is laid.&nbsp;
The water is let out of the mill-race upon these troughs through a wire-cloth
filter, covering them about two inches deep above the stones.&nbsp;
At the bottom, a lateral channel or race, running at right angles to
the troughs, conducts the waste water in a rapid, bubbling stream down
into the feeding-pond, which covers the space of about one-fifth of
an acre, close to the river, with which it is connected by a narrow
race gated also with a wire-cloth, to prevent the little living mites
from being carried off before their time.</p>
<p>This may serve to give the reader some approximate idea of the construction
of the fish-fold.&nbsp; The next process is the stocking it with the
breeding ewes of the sea and river.&nbsp; The female salmon is caught
in the spawning season with a net, and the ova are expressed from her
by passing the hand gently down the body, when she is again put into
the river to go on her way.&nbsp; The manager told me that they generally
reckoned upon a thousand eggs to a pound of the salmon caught.&nbsp;
Thus fourteen good-sized fish would stock the twenty-five troughs.&nbsp;
When hatched, the little things run down into the race-way, which carries
them into the feeding-pond.&nbsp; Here they are fed twice daily, with
five pounds of beef&rsquo;s liver pulverised.&nbsp; They remain in this
water-yard from April to autumn, when the gate is raised and they are
let out into the river.&nbsp; And it is a very singular and interesting
fact that those only go which have got their sea-coats on them, or have
reached the &ldquo;smolt&rdquo; character.&nbsp; The smaller fry remain
in the pond until, as it has been said in higher circles of society,
their beards are grown, or, in their case, until their scales are grown,
to fit them for the rough and tumble of salt-water life.</p>
<p>The growth of the little bull-headed mites, after being turned into
the river-pasture, is wonderful&mdash;more rapid than that of lambs
of the Southdown breed.&nbsp; The keeper had marked some of them, on
letting them out, by clipping the dorsal fin.&nbsp; On being caught
six or eight months afterward, they weighed from five to seven pounds
against half a pound each when sent forth to take care of themselves.&nbsp;
The proprietors of the fisheries defray the expense of this breeding
establishment, being taxed only twopence in the pound of their rental.&nbsp;
This, of course, they get back with large interest and profit from the
tenant-farmers of the river.&nbsp; As a proof of the enhanced production
of the Tay fisheries under this cultivation the fact will suffice, that
they now rent for &pound;14,000 a year against &pound;11,000 under the
old system.</p>
<p>Salmon-breeding is doubtless destined to rank with sheep-culture
and cattle-culture in the future.&nbsp; The remotest colonies of Great
Britain are moving in the matter with vigor and almost enthusiasm.&nbsp;
Vessels have been constructed on purpose to convey this fair and mottled
stock of British rivers to those of Australia and New Zealand.&nbsp;
In France, fish-farming has become a large and lucrative occupation.&nbsp;
I hope our own countrymen, who plume themselves on going ahead in utilitarian
enterprises, will show the world what they can do in this.&nbsp; Surely
our New England men, who claim to lead in American industries and ingenuities,
will not suffer half a million acres of river-pasturage to run to waste
for another half century, when it would fold and feed millions of salmon.&nbsp;
Once they herded in the Connecticut in such multitudes that a special
stipulation was inserted in the indentures of apprentices in the vicinity
of the river, that they should not be obliged to eat salmon more than
a certain number of times in a week.&nbsp; Now, if a salmon is caught
between the mouth and source of the river, it is blazoned forth in the
newspapers as a very extraordinary and unnatural event.&nbsp; There
is no earthly reason why the Connecticut should not breed and supply
as great a number of these excellent and beautiful fish as the Tay.&nbsp;
Its waters are equally pure and quiet as those of the Scotch river.&nbsp;
Every acre of the Connecticut, from the northernmost bridge that spans
it in Vermont to its debouchment at Saybrook, might be made productive
of as great a value as any onion-garden acre at Wethersfield.</p>
<p>The salmon-shepherd at Stormontfields, having fully explained the
labors and duties of his charge, rowed me across the Tay, and I continued
my walk highly gratified in having seen one of the new industries which
this age is adding to the different cultures provided for the sustentation
and comfort of human life.&nbsp; The whole way to Dunkeld was full of
interest, nature and history making every mile a scene to delight the
eye and exhilarate the mind.&nbsp; The first considerable village I
passed through was Stanley, which gives the name to that old family
of British peers known in history by the battle-cry of a badly-pressed
sovereign, &ldquo;On, Stanley, on!&rdquo;&nbsp; Murthley Castle, the
seat of Sir William Stewart, and the beautiful grounds which front and
surround it, will excite the admiration of the traveller and pay him
well for a moment&rsquo;s pause to peruse its illuminated pages opened
to his view.&nbsp; The baronet is regarded as an eccentric man, perhaps
chiefly because he has built a splendid Roman Catholic chapel quite
near to his mansion and supports a priest of that order mostly for his
own spiritual good.&nbsp; Near Dunkeld, Birnam Hill lifts its round,
dark, bushy head to the height of over 1,500 feet, grand and grim, as
if it wore the bonnet of Macbeth and hid his dagger beneath its tartan
cloak of firs.&nbsp; &ldquo;Birnam Wood,&rdquo; which Shakespeare&rsquo;s
genius has made one of the immortals among earthly localities, was the
setting of that hill in his day, and perhaps centuries before it.&nbsp;
Crossing the Tay by a magnificent bridge, you are in the famous old
city and capital of ancient Caledonia, Dunkeld.&nbsp; Here centre some
of the richest rivulets of Scotch history, ecclesiastical and military,
of church and state, cowl and crown.&nbsp; Walled in here, on the upper
waters of the Tay, by dark and heavily-wooded mountains, it was just
the place for the earliest monks to select as the site of one of their
cloistered communities.&nbsp; The two best saints ever produced by these
islands, St. Columba and St. Cuthbert, are said to have been connected
with the religious foundations of this little sequestered city.&nbsp;
The old cathedral, having been knocked about like other Roman Catholic
edifices in the sledge-hammer crusades of the Reformation, was <i>ruined</i>
very picturesquely, as a tourist, with one of Murray&rsquo;s red-book
guides in his hand, would be likely to say.&nbsp; But the choir was
rebuilt and fitted up for worship by the late Duke of Atholl at the
expense of about &pound;5,000.</p>
<p>Of this duke I must say a few words, for he has left the greenest
monument to his memory that a man ever planted over his grave.&nbsp;
He did something more and better than roofing the choir of a ruined
cathedral.&nbsp; He roofed a hundred hills and valleys with a larch-and-fir
work that will make them as glorious and beautiful as Lebanon forever.&nbsp;
One of the most illustrious and eloquent of the Iroquois aristocracy
was a chief called Corn-planter.&nbsp; This Duke of Atholl should be
named and known for evermore as the great Tree-planter of Christendom.&nbsp;
We have already dwelt upon the benefaction that such a man leaves to
coming generations.&nbsp; This Scotch nobleman virtually founded a new
order of knighthood far more useful and honorable than the Order of
the Garter.&nbsp; To talk of <i>garters</i>!&mdash;why, he not only
put the cold, ragged shivering hills of Scotland into garters, but into
stockings waist high, and doublets and bonnets and shoes of beautifully
green and thick fir-plaid.&nbsp; He planted 11,000 square acres with
the larch alone; and thousands of these acres stood up edgewise against
mountains and hills so steep that the planters must have spaded the
holes with ropes around their waists to keep them from falling down
the precipice.&nbsp; It is stated that he had twenty-seven millions
of the larch alone planted on his mountainous estates, besides several
millions of other trees.&nbsp; Now, it is doubtful if the whole region
thus dibbled with this tree-crop yielded an average rental of one English
shilling per acre as a pasturage for sheep.&nbsp; On passing through
miles and miles of this magnificent wood-grain and taking an estimate
of its value, I put it at 10s., or $2 40c. per tree.&nbsp; Of the twenty-seven
millions of larches thus planted, ten must be worth that sum; making
alone, without counting the rest, &pound;5,000,000, or $24,000,000.&nbsp;
It is quite probable that the larches, firs and other trees now covering
the Atholl estates, would sell for &pound;10,000,000 if brought to the
hammer.&nbsp; But he was not only the greatest arboriculturist in the
world, but the founder of tree-farming as a productive industry as well
as a decorative art.&nbsp; Already it has transformed the Highlands
of Scotland and trebled their value, as well as clothed them with a
new and beautiful scenery.&nbsp; What we call the Scotch larch was not
originally a native of that country.&nbsp; Close to the cathedral in
Dunkeld stand the two patriarchs of the family, first introduced into
Scotland from Switzerland in 1737.</p>
<p>Having remained the best part of two days in Dunkeld, I held on northward,
through heavily-shaded and winding glen and valley to Blair Atholl.&nbsp;
For the whole distance of twenty miles the country is quite Alpine,
wild and grand, with mountains larched or firred to the utmost reach
and tenure of soil for roots; deep, dark gorges pouring down into the
narrowing river their foamy, dashing streams; mansions planted here
and there on sloping lawns showing sunnily through groves and parks;
now a hamlet of cottages set in the side of a lofty hill, now a larger
village opening suddenly upon you at the turning of the turnpike road.&nbsp;
I reached Blair Atholl at about dark, and lodged at the largest hotel
I slept in between London and John O&rsquo;Groat&rsquo;s.&nbsp; It is
virtually the tourist&rsquo;s inn; for this is the centre of some of
the most interesting and striking sceneries and localities in Scotland.&nbsp;
Glens, waterfalls, stream, torrent, mountain and valley, with their
romantic histories, make this a very attractive region to thousands
of summer travellers from England and other countries.&nbsp; The railway
from Perth to Inverness via Dunkeld and Blair Atholl, has just opened
up this secluded Scotch Switzerland to multitudes who never would have
seen it without the help of the Iron Horse.&nbsp; A month previous,
this point had been the most distant in Scotland from steam-routes of
transportation and travel.&nbsp; Now southern sportsmen were hiring
up &ldquo;the shooting&rdquo; for many miles on both sides of the line,
making the hills and glens echo with their fusillades.&nbsp; Blair Castle,
the duke&rsquo;s mansion, is a very ordinary building in appearance,
looking from the public road like a large four-story factory painted
white, with small, old-fashioned windows.&nbsp; He himself was lying
in a very painful and precarious condition, with a cancer in the throat,
from which it was the general impression that he never would recover.&nbsp;
The day preceding, the Queen had visited him, while <i>en route</i>
for Balmoral, having gone sixty miles out of her way to comfort him
with such an expression of her sympathy.</p>
<p>The next day I reached the northern boundary of the Duke of Atholl&rsquo;s
estates, having walked for full forty miles continuously through it.&nbsp;
Passed over a very bleak, treeless, barren waste of mountain and moorland,
most of it too rocky or soilless for even heather.&nbsp; The dashing,
flashing, little Garry, which I had followed for a day or two, thinned
and narrowed down to a noisy brook as I ascended towards its source.&nbsp;
For a long distance the country was exceedingly wild and desolate.&nbsp;
Terrible must be the condition of a man benighted therein, especially
in winter.&nbsp; There were standing beacons all along the road for
miles, to indicate the track when it was buried in drifting snow.&nbsp;
These were painted posts, about six or eight feet high, planted on the
rocky, river side of the road, at a few rods interval, to guide the
traveller and keep him from dashing over the concealed precipices.&nbsp;
About the middle of the afternoon I reached the summit of the two watersheds,
where a horse&rsquo;s hoof might so dam a balancing stream as to send
it southward into the Tay or northward into the Moray Firth.&nbsp; Soon
a rivulet welled out in the latter direction with a decided current.&nbsp;
It was the Spey.&nbsp; A few miles brought me suddenly into a little,
glorious world of beauty.&nbsp; The change of theatrical sceneries could
hardly have produced a more sudden and striking contrast than this presented
to the wild, cold, dark waste through which I had been travelling for
a day.&nbsp; It was Strathspey; and I doubt if there is another view
in Scotland, of the same dimensions, to equal it.&nbsp; It was indescribably
grand and beautiful, if you could blend the meaning of these two commonly-coupled
adjectives into one qualification, as you can blend two colors on the
easel.&nbsp; To get the full enjoyment of the scene at one draught,
you should enter it first from the south, after having travelled for
twenty miles without seeing a sheaf of wheat or patch of vegetation
tilled by the hand of man.&nbsp; I know nothing in America to compare
it with or to help the American reader to an approximate idea of it.&nbsp;
Imagine a land-lake, apparently shut in completely by a circular wall
of mountains of every stature, the tallest looking over the shoulders
of the lower hills, like grand giants standing in steel helmets and
green doublets and gilded corselets, to see the soft and quiet beauty
of the valley sleeping under their watch and ward.&nbsp; As the sun-bursts
from the strath-skies above darted out of their shifting cloud-walls
and flashed a flush of light upon the solemn brows of these majestic
apostles of nature one by one, they stood haloed, like the favored saints
in Scripture in the overflow of the Transfiguration.&nbsp; It was just
the kind of day to make the scene glorious indescribably.&nbsp; The
clouds and sky were in the happiest disposition for the brilliant plays
and pictures of light and shade, and dissolving views of fascinating
splendor succeeded and surpassed each other at a minute&rsquo;s interval.&nbsp;
Now, the great land-lake, on whose bosom floated in the sunlight a thousand
islands oat-and-barley-gilded, and rimmed with the green and purple
verdure of the turnip and rutabaga, was all set a-glow by a luminous
flood from the opening clouds above.&nbsp; The next moment they closed
this disparted seam in their drapery, and opened a side one upon the
still, grave faces of the surrounding mountains; and, for a few minutes,
the smile went round from one to the other, and the great centurions
of the hills looked happy and almost human in the gleam.&nbsp; Then
shade&rsquo;s turn came in the play, and it played its part as perfectly
as light.&nbsp; It put in the touch of the old Italian masters, giving
an everchanging background to all the sublime pictures of the panorama.</p>
<p>I was not alone in the enjoyment of this scenery.&nbsp; For the first
time in this Walk I had a companion for a day.&nbsp; A clergyman from
near Edinburgh joined me at Kingussie, with whom I shared the luxury
of one of the most splendid views to be found in Scotland.&nbsp; Indeed,
few minds are so constituted as to prefer to see such natural pictures
alone.&nbsp; After a day&rsquo;s walk among these sceneries, we came
to the small village of Aviemore in the dusk of the evening.&nbsp; Here
we found that the only inn had been closed and turned into a private
residence, and that it was doubtful if a bed could be had for love or
money in the place.&nbsp; The railway through it to Inverness had just
been opened, and the navvies seemed still to constitute the largest
portion of the population.&nbsp; Neither of us had eaten any dinner,
and we were hungry as well as tired.&nbsp; Seeing a little, low cottage
near the railroad, with the sign of something for the public good over
the door, we went to it, and found that it had two rooms, one a kind
of rough, stone-floored shed, the other an apartment full ten feet square,
with two beds in it, which occupied half the entire space.&nbsp; But,
small as it was, the good man and woman made the most of it in the way
of entertainment, getting up a tea occasionally for persons stopping
over in the village at a meal-time, also selling small articles of grocery
to the laborers.&nbsp; Everything was brought from a distance, even
their bread, bacon and butter.&nbsp; Their stock of these fundamentals
was exhausted, so that they could not give us anything with our tea
until the arrival of the train from the north, which we all watched
with common interest.&nbsp; In the course of half an hour it came, and
soon our cabin-landlord brought in a large basket full of the simplest
necessaries of life, which we were quite prepared to enjoy as its best
luxuries.&nbsp; Soon a wood fire blazed for us in the double-bedded
parlor, and the unpainted deal table was spread in the fire-light with
a repast we relished with a pleasant appreciation.</p>
<p>My companion was bound northward by the next train in that direction,
and was sure to find good quarters for the night; but as there was not
an inn for ten miles on the route I was to travel, and as it was now
quite night and the road mostly houseless and lonely, I felt some anxiety
about my own lodging.&nbsp; But on inquiry I was very glad to find that
one of the two beds in the room was unoccupied and at my disposal.&nbsp;
So, having accompanied my fellow-traveller to the station and seen him
off with mutual good wishes, I returned to the cottage, and the mistress
replenished the fire with a new supply of chips and faggots, and I had
two or three hours of rare enjoyment, enhanced by some interesting books
I found on a shelf by the window.&nbsp; And this is a fact worthy of
note and full of good meaning.&nbsp; You will seldom find a cottage
in Scotland, however poor and small, without a shelf of books in it.&nbsp;
I retired rather earlier than usual; but before I fell asleep, the two
regular lodgers, who occupied the other bed, came in softly, and spoke
in a suppressed tone, as if reluctant to awaken me.&nbsp; And here I
was much impressed with another fact affiliated with the one I have
mentioned&mdash;that of praying as well as reading in the Scotch cottage.&nbsp;
After a little conversation just above a whisper, the elder of the two&mdash;and
he not twenty, while the other was apparently only sixteen&mdash;first
read, with full Scotch accent, one of the hard-rhymed psalms used in
the Scotch service.&nbsp; Then, after a short pause, he read with a
low, solemn voice a chapter in the Bible.&nbsp; A few minutes of silence
succeeded, as if a wordless prayer was going upward upon the still wings
of thought, which made no audible beating in their flight.&nbsp; It
was very impressive; an incident that I shall ever hold among the most
interesting of all I met with on my walk.&nbsp; They were not brothers
evidently, but most likely strangers thrown together on the railroad.&nbsp;
They doubtless came from different directions, but, from Highlands or
Lowlands, they came from Bible-lighted homes, whose &ldquo;voices of
the night&rdquo; were blended with the breathings of religious life
and instruction.&nbsp; Separated from such homes, they had agreed to
make this one after the same spiritual pattern, barring the parental
presence and teaching.</p>
<p>The next day after breakfast, took leave of my kind cottage hosts,
exchanging good wishes for mutual happiness.&nbsp; Went out of the amphitheatre
of Strathspey by a gateway into another, surrounded by mountains less
lofty and entirely covered with heather.&nbsp; For several miles beyond
Carr Bridge I passed over the wildest moorland.&nbsp; The road was marked
by posts about ten feet high, painted white within two feet of the top
and black above.&nbsp; These are planted about fifteen rods apart, to
guide the traveller in the drifting and blinding snows of winter.&nbsp;
The road over this cold, desolate waste exceeded anything I ever saw
in America, even in the most fashionable suburbs of New York and Boston.&nbsp;
It was as smooth and hard as a cement floor.&nbsp; Here on this treeless
wild, I met several men at work trimming the edges of the road by a
line, with as much precision and care as if they were laying out an
aisle in a flower garden.&nbsp; After a walk of about seventeen miles,
I reached Freeburn Inn about the middle of the afternoon, and as it
began to rain and to threaten bad weather for walking, I concluded to
stop there for the night, and found good quarters.</p>
<p>The rain continued in showers, and I feared I should be unable to
reach Inverness to spend the Sabbath.&nbsp; There was a cattle fair
at the inn, and a considerable number of farmers and dealers came together
notwithstanding the weather.&nbsp; Indeed, there were nearly as many
men and boys as animals on the ground.&nbsp; A score or more had come
in, each leading or driving a single cow or calf.&nbsp; The cattle generally
were evidently of the Gaelic origin and antecedents&mdash;little, chubby,
scraggy creatures, of all colors, but mostly black, with wide-branching
horns longer than their fore-legs.&nbsp; Their hair is long and as coarse
as a polar seal&rsquo;s, and they look as if they knew no more of housing
against snow, rain and wintry winds, or of a littered bed, than the
buffaloes beyond the upper waters of the Missouri.&nbsp; One would be
inclined to think they had lived from calf-hood on nothing but heather
or gorse, and that the prickly fodder had penetrated through their hides
and covered them with a growth midway between hair and bristles.&nbsp;
They will not average over 350 lbs. when dressed; still they seem to
hold their own among other breeds which have attracted so much attention.&nbsp;
This is probably because they can browse out a living where the Durham
and Devon would starve.</p>
<p>The sheep in this region are chiefly the old Scotch breed, with curling
horns and crocked faces and legs, such as are represented in old pictures.&nbsp;
The black seems to be spattered upon them, and looks as if the heather
would rub it off.&nbsp; The wool is long and coarse, giving them a goat-like
appearance.&nbsp; They seem to predominate over any other breed in this
part of Scotland, yet not necessarily nor advantageously.&nbsp; A large
sheep farmer from England was staying at the inn, with whom I had much
conversation on the subject.&nbsp; He said the Cheviots were equally
adapted to the Highlands, and thought they would ultimately supplant
the black faces.&nbsp; Although he lived in Northumberland, full two
hundred miles to the south, he had rented a large sheep-walk, or mountain
farm, in the Western Highlands, and had come to this section to buy
or hire another tract.&nbsp; He kept about 4,000 sheep, and intended
to introduce the Cheviots upon these Scotch holdings, as their bodies
were much heavier and their wool worth nearly double that of the old
black-faced breed.&nbsp; Sheep are the principal source of wealth in
the whole of the North and West of Scotland.&nbsp; I was told that sometimes
a flock of 20,000 is owned by one man.&nbsp; The lands on which they
are pastured will not rent above one or two English shillings per acre;
and a flock even of 1,000 requires a vast range, as may be indicated
by the reply of a Scotch farmer to an English one, on being asked by
the latter, &ldquo;How many sheep do you allow to the acre?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ah, mon,&rdquo; was the answer, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s nae the way
we count in the Highlands; it&rsquo;s how monie acres to the sheep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At about two p.m., the showers becoming less frequent, I set out
with the hope of reaching Inverness before night.&nbsp; The wind was
high, the road muddy, or <i>dirty</i>, as the English call that condition;
and the rain frequently compelled me to seek shelter in some wayside
cottage, or under the fir-trees that were planted in groves at narrow
intervals.&nbsp; The walking was heavy and slow in face of the frequent
showers, and a strong gale from the north-east; so that I was exceedingly
glad to reach an inn within four miles of Inverness, where I promised
myself comfortable lodgings for the night.&nbsp; It was a rather large,
but comfortless-looking house, evidently concentrating all its entertainment
for travellers in the tap-room.&nbsp; After considerable hesitation,
the landlady consented to give me bed and board; and directed &ldquo;the
lassie&rdquo; to make a fire for me in a large and very respectable
room on the second floor.&nbsp; I soon began to feel quite at home by
its side.&nbsp; My boots had leaked on the way and my feet were very
wet and cold; and it was with a pleasant sense of comfort that I changed
stockings, and warmed myself at the ruddy grate, while the storm seemed
to increase without.&nbsp; After waiting about an hour for tea, I heard
the lassie&rsquo;s heavy footstep on the stairs; a knock&mdash;the door
opens&mdash;now for the tray and the steaming tea-pot, and happy vision
of bread, oatcake and Scotch <i>scones</i>!&nbsp; Alas! what a falling-off
was there from this delicious expectation!&nbsp; The lassie had brought
a severe and peremptory message from the master, who had just returned
home.&nbsp; And she delivered it commiseratingly but decidedly.&nbsp;
She was to tell me from him that there was nothing in the house to set
before me; that the fair the day before had eaten out the whole stock
of his provisions; in short, that I was to take my staff and walk on
to Inverness.&nbsp; It was in vain that I remonstrated, pleaded and
urged wet feet, the darkness, the wind and rain.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is
so,&rdquo; said the lassie, &ldquo;and can&rsquo;t be otherwise.&rdquo;&nbsp;
She tried to encourage me to the journey by shortening the distance
by half its actual miles, saying it was only two, when it was full four,
and they of the longest kind.&nbsp; So I went out into the night in
my wet clothes, and put the best face and foot to the head-wind and
rain that I could bring to bear against them.&nbsp; Both were strong,
beating and drenching; and it was so dark that I could hardly see the
road.&nbsp; In the course of half an hour, I made the lassie&rsquo;s
two miles, and in another, the whole of the actual distance, and found
comfortable quarters in one of the temperance inns of Inverness, reaching
it between nine and ten at night.&nbsp; Here I spent a quiet Sabbath,
which I greatly enjoyed.</p>

<p>Inverness is an interesting, good-sized town, with an intellectual
and pleasing countenance, of somewhat aristocratic and self-complacent
expression.&nbsp; It is considered the capital of the Highlands, and
wears a decidedly metropolitan air.&nbsp; It is well situated on the
Ness, just at its <i>debouchement</i> into the Moray Firth,&mdash;a
river that runs with a Rhine-like current through the town and is spanned
with a suspension bridge.&nbsp; It has streets of city-built and city-bred
buildings, showing wealth and elegance.&nbsp; Several edifices are in
process of erection that will rank with some of the best in Edinburgh
and Glasgow.&nbsp; It has a long and pretentious history, reaching back
to the Romans, and dashed with the romance of the wild ages of the country.&nbsp;
Oliver Cromwell, or Sledgehammer II., Macbeth, Thane of Cawdor, Queen
Mary, Prince Charlie, and other historical celebrities, entered their
names and doings on the records of this goodly town.</p>
<p>On Monday, Sept. 21st, I set out with a good deal of animation on
the last week-stage of my journey, which I was anxious to accomplish
as soon as possible, as the weather was becoming unsettled with frequent
rain.&nbsp; Reached Invergordon, passing through a most interesting
section of country, full of very fertile straths.&nbsp; It was the part
of Ross-shire lying on the Moray and Beauly Firths and divided by rivers
dashing down through the wooded gorges of the mountains.&nbsp; I saw
here some of the most productive land in Scotland.&nbsp; Hundreds of
acres were studded with wheat and barley stooks, and about an equal
space was covered with standing grain, though so near the month of October.&nbsp;
Plantations, parks, gentlemens&rsquo; seats, glens deep and grand, fir-clad
mountains, villages, hamlets and scattered cottages made up the features
of every changing view.&nbsp; Indeed, one travelling for a week between
Perth and Inverness comes upon such a region as this with pleasant surprise,
as upon an exotic section, imported from another latitude.</p>
<p>The next day I held on northward, though the weather was very unfavorable
and the walking heavy and fatiguing.&nbsp; Passed what seemed the bold
and ridgy island of Cromarty, so associated with the venerated memory
of Hugh Miller.&nbsp; The beating rain drove me frequently to the wayside
cottages for shelter; and in every one of them I was received with kind
words and pleasant looks.&nbsp; One of these was occupied by an old
woman in the regular Scotch cap&mdash;a venerable old saint, with her
Bible and psalm-book library on her window-sill, and her peat fire burning
cheerily.&nbsp; When on leaving I intimated that I was from America,
she followed me out into the road, asking me a hundred questions about
the country and its condition.&nbsp; She had three sons in Montreal,
and felt a mother&rsquo;s interest in the very name America.&nbsp; The
cottage was one of a long street of them by the sea-side, and I supposed
it was a fishing village; but I learned from her that the people were
mostly the evicted tenants of the Duke of Sutherland, who were turned
out of his county some thirty years ago to make room for sheep.&nbsp;
I made only eleven miles this day on account of the rain, and was glad
to find cheery and comfortable quarters in an excellent inn kept by
a widow and her three daughters in Tain.&nbsp; Nothing could exceed
their kindness and attention, which evidently flowed more from a disposition
than from a professional habit of making their guests at home for a
pecuniary or business consideration.&nbsp; I reached their house about
the middle of the afternoon, cold and wet, after several hours&rsquo;
walk in the rain, and was received as one of the family; the eldest
daughter, who had all the grace and intelligence of a cultivated lady,
helping me off with my wet overcoat, and even offering to pull off my
water-soaked boots&mdash;an office no American could accept, and which
I gently declined, taking the will for the deed.&nbsp; A large number
of Scotch <i>navvies</i> were at the inns of the town, making an obstreperous
<i>auroval</i> in celebration of the monthly pay-day.&nbsp; They had
received the day preceding a month&rsquo;s wages, and they were now
drinking up their money with the most reckless hilarity; swallowing
the pay of five long hours at the pick in a couple of gills of whiskey.&nbsp;
How strange that men can work in rain, cold and heat at the shovel for
a whole day, then drink up the whole in two hours at the gin-shop!&nbsp;
These pickmen pioneers of the Iron Horse, with their worst habits, are
yet a kind of John-the-Baptists to the march and mission of civilization,
preparing its way in the wilderness, and bringing secluded and isolated
populations to its light and intercourse.&nbsp; It is wonderful how
they are working their way northward among these bald and thick-set
mountains.&nbsp; When I first visited Scotland, in 1846, the only piece
of railroad north of the Forth was that between Dundee and Arbroath,
hardly an hour long.&nbsp; Now the iron pathways are running in every
direction, making grand junctions at points which had never felt the
navvy&rsquo;s pick a dozen years ago.&nbsp; Here is one heading towards
John O&rsquo;Groat&rsquo;s, grubbing its way like a mole around the
firths, cutting spiral gains into the rock-ribbed hills, bridging the
deep and dark gorges, and holding on steadily north-poleward with a
brave faith and faculty of patience that moves mountains, or as much
of them as blocks its course.&nbsp; The progress is slow, silent, but
sure.&nbsp; The world, busy in other doings, does not hear the pick,
nor the speech of the powder when it speaks to a huge rock a-straddle
the path.&nbsp; The world, even including the shareholders, hears but
little, if anything, of the progress of the work for months, perhaps
for a year.&nbsp; Then the consummation is announced in the form of
an invitation to the public to &ldquo;assist&rdquo; at the opening of
a railroad through towns and villages that never saw the daylight the
locomotive brings in its wake.&nbsp; So it will be here.&nbsp; Some
day, in the present decade, there will be an excursion train advertised
to run from London to John O&rsquo;Groat&rsquo;s; and perhaps the lineal
descendant of Sigurd, or some other old Norse jarl, will wear the conductor&rsquo;s
belt and cap or drive the engine.</p>
<p>The weather was still unsettled, with much wind and rain.&nbsp; Resumed
my walk, and at about four miles from Tain, crossed the Dornoch Firth
in a sail ferry boat, and at noon reached Dornoch, the capital of Sutherlandshire.&nbsp;
This was one of the fourteen cities of Scotland; and its little, chubby
cathedral, and the tower of the old bishop&rsquo;s palace still give
it a kind of Canterbury air.&nbsp; The Earls of Sutherland for many
generations lie interred within the walls of this ancient church.&nbsp;
After stopping here for an hour or two for dinner, I continued on to
Golspie, the residence of the mighty lord of the manor, or the owner,
master and human disposer of this great mountain county of Scotland.&nbsp;
It is stated that full four-fifths of it belong to him who now holds
the title, and that his other great estates, added to this territory,
make him the largest landowner in Great Britain and probably in Europe.&nbsp;
Just before reaching Golspie, a lofty, sombre mountain, with its bald
head enveloped in the mist, and which I had been two hours apparently
in passing, cleared away and revealed its full stature&mdash;and more.&nbsp;
Towering up from its topmost summit, a tall column lifted a human figure
in bronze skyward cloud-high and frequently higher still.&nbsp; I believe
the brazen face that thus looks into the pure and holy skies without
blushing, is a duplicate of the one worn in human flesh by His Grace,
Evictor I., who unpeopled his great county of many thousands of human
inhabitants, and made nearly its whole area of 18,000 square miles a
sheep-walk.&nbsp; But I will not break the seal of that history.&nbsp;
It was full of bitter experience to multitudes.&nbsp; Not for the time
being was it joyous, but grievous exceedingly&mdash;surpassing endurance
to many.&nbsp; But it is all over now.&nbsp; The ship-loads of evicted
men and women who looked their last upon Scotland while its mountains
and glens were reddened with the flames of their burning cottages, carried
away with them a bitter feeling in their hearts which years of better
experience did not soften.&nbsp; Not for their good did it seem in the
motive of the transaction; but for their good it worked most blessedly.&nbsp;
It was a rough transplanting, and the tenderest fibres of human affection
broke and bled under the uptearing; but they took root in the Western
World, and grew luxuriantly under the light and dew of a happier destiny.&nbsp;
It was hard for fathers and mothers who were taking on the frostwork
of age upon their brows; but for their children it was the birth of
a new life; for them it was the introduction to a future which had a
sun in it, rayful and radiant with the beams of hope and promise.&nbsp;
Let those who denounce and deplore this harsh unpeopling come and stand
upon the cold, bleak summit of one of these Sutherland mountains.&nbsp;
Let them bring their compasses, or some other instrument for measuring
the angles, sines and cosines of human conditions.&nbsp; Plant your
theodolite here; wipe the telescope&rsquo;s eye with your handkerchief;
look your keenest in the line of the lineage of these evicted thousands.&nbsp;
Steady, now! while the most tranquil light of the future is on the pathway
of your eye.&nbsp; This first reach of your vision is the life-track
of the fathers and mothers unhoused among these mountains.&nbsp; Look
on beyond, over the longer life-line of their children; then farther
still under the horizon of the remotest future to the track of their
childrens&rsquo; children.&nbsp; Can you make an angle of a single degree&rsquo;s
subtension in the hereditary conditions of these generations, or a dozen
beyond?&nbsp; Can you detect a point of departure by which the second
generation would have diverged from the first, or the third from the
second, and have attained to a higher life of comfort, intelligence,
social and political position had they remained in these mountain cottages,
grubbed on their cottage farms, and lived from hand to mouth on stinted
rations of oatmeal and potatoes, as their ancestors had done from time
immemorial?&nbsp; Can you see among all the hopeful possibilities of
Time&rsquo;s tomorrows, any such change for the better?&nbsp; You can
sight no such prospect with your telescope in that direction.&nbsp;
Turn it around and sweep the horizon of that other condition into which
they were thrust, weeping and wrathful against their will.&nbsp; Follow
them across the Atlantic to North America, to their homes in the States
and in the Canadas.&nbsp; Measure the angle they made in this transposition,
and the latitude and longitude of social and moral life they have reached
from this Sutherland point of departure.&nbsp; The sons of the fathers
and mothers who had their family nests stirred up so cruelly, and scattered,
like those of rooks, from their holdings in the cliffs, gorges and glens
of these cold mountains, are now among the most substantial and respected
men of the Western World.&nbsp; Some of them to-day are mayors of towns
of larger population than the whole county of Sutherland.&nbsp; Some,
doubtless, are Members of Congress, representing each a constituency
of one hundred thousand persons, and a vast amount of intelligence,
wealth and industry.&nbsp; They are merchants, manufacturers, farmers,
teachers and preachers, filling all the professions and occupations
of the continent.&nbsp; Is not that an angle of promise to your telescope?&nbsp;
Is not that a line of divergence which has conducted these evicted populations,
at a small distance from this point of departure, into the better latitudes
of human experience?&nbsp; The selling of this Scotch Joseph to America
was more purely and simply a pecuniary transaction than that recorded
in Scripture; for in that the unkind and jealous brothers sold the innocent
boy for envy, not for the love of pelf, though the Ishmaelites bought
him on speculation.&nbsp; But not for envy was the Sutherland lad sold
and shipped to a foreign land, but rather for a contemptuous estimate
of his money value.&nbsp; The proprietor-patriarch of the county took
to a more quiet and profitable favorite&mdash;the sheep, and sent it
to feed on a pasture enriched with the ashes of Joseph&rsquo;s cottage.&nbsp;
It is to be feared he meant only money; but Providence meant a blessing
beyond the measurement of money to the evicted; and what Providence
meant it made for him and his posterity, and they are now enjoying it.</p>
<p>Dunrobin Castle, the grand residence of the Duke of Sutherland, looks
off upon the sea at Golspie.&nbsp; It is truly a magnificent edifice,
ranking with the first palaces in Christendom.&nbsp; Nearly eight hundred
years has it been in building, though, I believe, all that commands
admiration for stature and style is the work of the present century.&nbsp;
Whatever the Sutherland family may have been in local position and history
in past centuries, one of the noblest women that ever ennobled the nobility
of Great Britain, has given the name a celebrity and an estimation in
America which all who ever wore it before never won for it.&nbsp; The
Duchess of Sutherland, the noble and large-hearted sister of Lord Morpeth-Carlisle,
has given to the coronet she wore a lustre brighter to the American
eye than the light of diadems which have dazzled millions in Europe.&nbsp;
When the Fatherhood of God and the Brotherhood of Men shall come to
its high place in the hearts of nations as the crown-faith of all their
creeds, what this noble woman felt, said and did for the Slave in his
bonds shall be mentioned of her by the preachers of that great doctrine
in years to come.&nbsp; When the jewels of Humanity&rsquo;s memories
shall be made up, she who, as it were, bent down to him in his prison-house
and put her jewelled hands to the breaking of his fetters, shall stand,
with women of the same sympathy, only next to her who broke her box
of ointment on the Saviour&rsquo;s feet.</p>
<p>The next day made a walk to Helmsdale, a distance of about eighteen
miles.&nbsp; The weather was favorable, the scenery grand and varied
with almost every feature that could give it interest.&nbsp; The finest
of roads wound in and out around the mountain headlands, so that alternately
I was walking upon a lofty esplanade overlooking the still expanse of
the steel-blue sea, then facing inward to the gorges of the grand and
solemn hills.&nbsp; Found comfortable quarters in one of the inns of
Helmsdale, a vigorous, busy, fishing village nestling under the shadow
of the mountains at the mouth of a little river of the same name.&nbsp;
After tea, went down to the wharf or quay and had some conversation
with one of the masters of the business.&nbsp; He cured and put up about
30,000 barrels of herrings himself in a season, employing, while it
lasted, 500 persons.&nbsp; Their chief market is the North of Europe,
especially Poland, and the business was consequently much depressed
on account of the troubles in that country.&nbsp; The occupation of
this little sea-side village illustrated the ramifications of commerce.&nbsp;
They imported their salt from Liverpool, their staves from Norway and
their hoops from London.</p>
<p>Set out again immediately after breakfast, feeling that I was drawing
near to the end of my journey.&nbsp; I was soon in the treeless county
of Caithness, so fraught with the wild romance of the Norsemen.&nbsp;
Passed over the bleakest district I had yet seen, called Old Ord, a
cold, rough, cloud-breeding region that the very heavens above seem
to frown upon with a scowl of dissatisfaction.&nbsp; Still, the road
over this dark, mountain desert, though staked on each side to keep
the traveller from wandering in the blinding snows of winter, was as
beautifully kept as the carriage-way in the park of Dunrobin Castle.&nbsp;
The sending of an English queen to conciliate the Welsh, by giving birth
to a son in one of their castles, was not a much better stroke of policy
than that of England in perforating Scotland to the Northern Sea with
this unparalleled and splendid road, constructed at first for a military
purpose.&nbsp; I heard a man repeat a couplet, probably of unwritten
poetry, in popular vogue among the Highlands, and which has quite an
Irish collocation of ideas.&nbsp; It is spoken thus, as far as I can
recollect&mdash;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who knew these roads ere they were
made<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should bless the Lord for General
Wade.</p>
<p>I doubt if there are ten consecutive miles of carriage-road in America
that could compare for excellence with that over the desert of Old Ord.&nbsp;
I was overtaken by a heavy shower before I had made the <i>trajet</i>,
and was glad to reach one of the most comfortable inns of the Highlands,
in the beautiful, romantic and picturesque glen of Berriedale.&nbsp;
Here, nestling between lofty mountain ridges, which warded off the blasting
sea-winds sweeping across from Norway, were plantations and groves of
trees, almost the only ones I saw in the county.&nbsp; Nothing could
exceed the hospitality of the family that kept the large, white-faced
hotel at the bottom of this pleasant valley; especially after I incidentally
said that I had walked all the way from London to see the country and
people.&nbsp; They admitted me into the kitchen and gave me a seat by
the great peat fire, where I had a long talk with them, beginning with
the mother.&nbsp; Having intimated that I was an American, the whole
family, old and young, including the landlord, gathered around me and
had a hundred questions to ask.&nbsp; They related many incidents about
the great eviction in Sutherland, which was an event that seems to make
a large stock of legendary and unwritten stories, like the old <i>Sagas</i>
of the Northmen.&nbsp; When I had dried my clothes and eaten a comfortable
dinner before their kitchen fire and resumed my staff, they all followed
me out to the road, and then with their wishes for a good journey as
long as I was in hearing distance.&nbsp; Continued my walk around headlands,
now looking seaward, now mountainward, now ascending on heather-bound
esplanades, now descending in zig-zag directions into deep glens, over
massive and elegant bridges that spanned the mountain streams and their
steep and jagged banks.&nbsp; After a walk of eighteen miles, put up
at an inn a little north of the village of Dunbeath, kept by an intelligent
and industrious farmer.&nbsp; The rain had continued most of the day,
and I was obliged to seek shelter sometimes under a stunted tree which
helped out the protecting power of a weather-beaten umbrella; now in
the doorway of an open stable or cow-shed, and once with my back against
the door of a wayside church, which kept off the rain in one direction.&nbsp;
This being a kind of border-season between summer and autumn, there
were no fires in the inns generally except in the kitchen, and I soon
learned to make for that, and always found a kindly welcome to its comforts;
though sometimes the good woman and her lassie would look a little flushed
at having their busiest culinary operations revealed so suddenly to
a stranger.&nbsp; Some of these kitchens are fitted for sleeping apartments;
occasionally having two tiers of berths like a ship&rsquo;s cabin, slightly
and rudely curtained.</p>
<p>The family of this wayside inn, seemingly like every other family
in the country, had connections in America, embracing brothers, uncles
and cousins.&nbsp; I was shown a little paper casket of hair flower-work,
sent by <i>post</i>!&nbsp; It was wrought of locks of every shade and
tint, from the snow of a grandmother over one hundred years of age to
the little, sunny curls of the youngest child in the circle of kindred
families.&nbsp; The Scotch branch had collected specimens from relatives
in Great Britain and forwarded them to the family in America, one of
whose daughters had worked them into two bouquets of flowers, sending
one of them by post to this little, white cottage on the Northern Sea,
as a memento of affection.&nbsp; What enhanced the beauty of this interchange
was the fact, that forty-eight years had elapsed since the landlord&rsquo;s
brother left his native land for New England, and had never seen it
since.&nbsp; Still, the cousins, who had never seen each other&rsquo;s
faces, had kept up an affectionate correspondence.&nbsp; A son and son-in-law
of the brother in America were in the Federal army, and here was a sea-divided
family filled with all the sad, silent solicitude of affection for beloved
ones exposed to the fearful hazards of a war sundering more ties of
blood-relationship than any other ever waged on earth.</p>
<p>Saturday, September 27th.&nbsp; Resumed my walk with increased animation,
feeling myself within two days&rsquo; distance of its end.&nbsp; The
scenery softens down to an agricultural aspect, the country declining
northerly toward the sea.&nbsp; Passed through a well-cultivated district,
never unpeopled or wasted by eviction, but held by a kind of even yeomanry
of proprietors.&nbsp; The cottages are comfortable, resembling the white
houses of New England considerably.&nbsp; They are nearly all of one
story, with a chimney at each end, broadside to the road, and a door
in the middle, dividing the house into two apartments.&nbsp; They are
built of stone, the newest ones having a slate roof.&nbsp; Some of them
are whitewashed, others so liberally jointed with mortar as to give
them a bright and cheery appearance.&nbsp; These, of course, are the
last edition of cottages, enlarged and amended in every way.&nbsp; The
old issues are ragged volumes, mostly bound in turf or bog grass, well
corded down with ropes of heather, giving the roof a singular ribby
look, rounded on the ridge.&nbsp; In many cases a stone is attached
to each end of the rope, so as to make it hug the thatch closely.&nbsp;
I noticed that in a considerable number of the old cottages, the stone
wall only reached up a foot or two from the ground, the rest being made
up of blocks of peat.&nbsp; Some of the oldest had no premonitory symptoms
of a chimney, except a hole in the roof for the smoke.&nbsp; These in
no way differed from the stone-and-turf cottages in Ireland.</p>
<p>Again occasional showers brought me into acquaintance with the people
living near the road.&nbsp; In every case I found them kind and hospitable,
giving me a pleasant welcome and the best seat by their peat-fire.&nbsp;
I sat by one an hour while the rain fell cold and fast outside.&nbsp;
The good woman and her daughter were busy baking barley-cakes.&nbsp;
They were the first I had seen, and I ate them with a peculiar zest
of appetite.&nbsp; Told them many stories about America in return for
a great deal of information about the customs and condition of the working-people.&nbsp;
They generally built their own cottages, costing from &pound;40 to &pound;50,
not counting their own labor.&nbsp; I met on the road scores of fishermen
returning to their homes at the conclusion of the herring season; and
was struck with their appearance in every way.&nbsp; They are truly
a stalwart race of men, broad-chested, of intelligent physiognomy, with
Scandinavian features fully developed.&nbsp; A half dozen of them followed
a horse-cart containing their nets, all done up in a round ball, like
a bladder of snuff, with the number of their boat marked upon it.</p>
<p>At about four p.m., I came in sight of the steeples of Wick, a brave
little city by the Norse Sea, which may not only be called the Wick
but the Candle of Northern Scotland; lighting, like a polar star, this
hyperborean shoreland of the British isle.&nbsp; I never entered a town
with livelier pleasure.&nbsp; It is virtually the last and farthest
on the mainland in this direction.&nbsp; Its history is full of interest.&nbsp;
Its great business is full of vigor, daring and danger.&nbsp; Here is
the great land-home of the Vikings of the nineteenth century; the indomitable
men who walk the roaring and crested billows of this Northern Ocean
in their black, tough sea-boats and bring ashore the hard-earned spoils
of the deep.&nbsp; This is the great metropolis of Fishdom.&nbsp; Eric
the Red, nor any other pre-Columbus navigator of the North American
Seas, ever mustered braver crews than these sea-boats carry to their
morning beats.&nbsp; Ten thousand of as hardy men as ever wrestled with
the waves, and threw them too, are out upon that wide water-wold before
the sun looks on it&mdash;half of them wearing the features of their
Norse lineage, as light-haired and crisp-whiskered as the sailors of
Harold the Fair-haired a thousand years ago.&nbsp; They come from all
the coasts of Scotland, from Orkney, Shetland, the Hebrides and Lewis
islands, and down out of the heart of the Highlands.&nbsp; It is a hard
and daring industry they follow, and hundreds of graves on the shore
and thousands at the bottom of the sea have been made with no names
on them, as the long record of the hazards they run in the perilous
occupation.&nbsp; But they keep their ranks full from year to year,
pushing out new boats marked with higher numbers.</p>
<p>The harbor has been dangerous and difficult of access, but of late
a great effort has been made to render it more safe and commodious.&nbsp;
The Scotch fisheries now yield from 600,000 to 700,000 barrels of herrings
annually, employing about 17,000 fishermen; Wick stands first among
all the fishing ports of the kingdom.&nbsp; It is a thriving town, well
supplied with churches, schools, hotels, banks and printing-offices.&nbsp;
Several new buildings are now being erected which will rank high in
architecture and add new features of elegance to the place.&nbsp; The
population is a vigorous, intelligent, highly moral and well-read community,
as I could not fail to notice on attending service on the Sabbath at
different places of worship.&nbsp; Wick is honored with this distinction&mdash;it
assembles a larger congregation of men to listen to the glad Evangel
on Sunday than any city of the world ever musters under one roof for
the same purpose.&nbsp; It is the out-door church of the fishermen.&nbsp;
They sometimes number 5,000 adult men, sea-beaten and sun-burnt, gathered
in from mountainous island and mainland all around the northern coasts
of Scotland.</p>
<p>Monday, Sept. 28th.&nbsp; The weather was favorable, and I set out
on my last day&rsquo;s walk northward with a sense of satisfaction I
could hardly describe.&nbsp; The scenery was beautiful in every direction.&nbsp;
The road was perfect up to the last rod; as well kept as if it ran through
a nobleman&rsquo;s park.&nbsp; The country most of the way was well
cultivated&mdash;oats being the principal crop.&nbsp; Here, almost within
sight of the Orkneys, I heard the clatter of the reaping machine, which,
doubtless, puts out the same utterance over and upon the sea at Land&rsquo;s
End.&nbsp; It has travelled fast and far since 1851, when it first made
its appearance in Europe in the Crystal Palace, as one of the wild,
impracticable &ldquo;notions&rdquo; of American genius.&nbsp; In Wick
I visited a newspaper establishment, and saw in operation one of the
old &ldquo;Columbians,&rdquo; or the American printing-press, surmounted
by the eagle of the Republic.&nbsp; The sewing-machine is in all the
towns and villages on the island.&nbsp; If there is not an American
clock at John O&rsquo;Groat&rsquo;s, I hope some of my fellow townsmen
will send one there, Bristol-built.&nbsp; They are pleasant tokens of
free-labor genius.&nbsp; No land tilled by slaves could produce them.&nbsp;
I saw many large and highly-cultivated farms on these last miles of
my walk.&nbsp; The country was proportionately divided between food
and fuel.&nbsp; Oats and barley constitute the grain-crops.&nbsp; The
uncultivated land interspersed with the yellow fields of harvest, is
reserved for <i>peat</i>&mdash;the poor man&rsquo;s fuel and his wealth.&nbsp;
For, were it not for the inexhaustible abundance of this cheap and accessible
firing, he could hardly inhabit this region.&nbsp; It would seem strange
to an American, who had not realised the difference of the two climates,
to see fields full of reapers on the very threshold of October, as I
saw them on this last day&rsquo;s walk.&nbsp; I counted twelve women
and two men in one field plying the sickle, all strongly-built and good-looking
and well-dressed withal.</p>
<p>The sea was still and blue as a lake.&nbsp; A lark was soaring and
warbling over it with as happy and hopeful a voice as if it were singing
over the greenest acres of an English meadow.&nbsp; When I had made
half of the seventeen miles between Wick and John O&rsquo;Groat&rsquo;s,
I began to look with the liveliest interest for the first glimpse of
the Orkneys; but projecting and ragged headlands intercepted the prospect.&nbsp;
About three p.m., as the road emerged from behind one of them, those
famous islands burst suddenly into view!&nbsp; There they were!&mdash;in
full sight, so near that their grain-fields and white cottages and all
their distinguishing features seemed within half a mile&rsquo;s distance.&nbsp;
This was the most interesting <i>coup d&rsquo;&oelig;il</i> that I ever
caught in any country.&nbsp; Here, then, after weeks and months of travel
on foot, I was at the end of my journey.&nbsp; Through all the days
of this period I had faced northward, and here was the <i>Ultima Thule</i>,
the goal and termination of my tour.&nbsp; The road to the sea diverged
from the main turnpike, which continued around the coast to Thurso.&nbsp;
Followed this branch a couple of miles, when it ended at the door of
a little, quiet, one-story inn on the very shore of the Pentland Firth.&nbsp;
It was a moment of the liveliest enjoyment to me.&nbsp; When I left
London, about the middle of July, I was slowly recovering from a severe
indisposition, and hardly expected to be able to make more than a few
miles of my projected walk.&nbsp; But I had gathered strength daily,
and when I brought up at this little inn at the very jumping-off end
of Scotland, I was fresher and more vigorous on foot than at any previous
stage of the journey.</p>
<p>Having found to my great satisfaction that they could give me a bed
for the night, I went with two gentlemen of the neighborhood to see
the site of the celebrated John O&rsquo;Groat&rsquo;s House, about a
mile and a half from the inn.&nbsp; There was only a footpath to it
across intervening fields, and when we reached it, a rather vigorous
exercise of the organ of individuality was requisite to &ldquo;locate&rdquo;
the foundations of &ldquo;the house that Jack built.&rdquo;&nbsp; Indeed,
pilgrims to the shrine of this famous domicile are liable to much disappointment
at finding so little remaining of a residence so historical.&nbsp; Literally
not one stone is left upon another.&nbsp; A large stone granary standing
near is said to have been built of the <i>debris</i> of the house, and
this helps out one&rsquo;s faith when struggling to believe in the existence
of such a building at all.&nbsp; A certain ridgy rising in the ground,
to which you try to give an octagonal shape, is pointed out as indicating
the foundations; but an unsatisfactory obscurity rests upon the whole
history of the establishment.&nbsp; Whether true or not, that history
of the house which one would prefer to believe runs thus:&mdash;</p>
<p>In the reign of James IV. of Scotland, three brothers, Malcolm, Gavin,
and John de Groat, natives of Holland, came to this coast of Caithness,
with a letter in Latin from that monarch recommending them to the protection
and countenance of his subjects hereabout.&nbsp; They got possession
of a large district of land, and in process of time multiplied and prospered
until they numbered eight different proprietors by the name of Groat.&nbsp;
On one of the annual dinners instituted to commemorate their arrival
in Caithness, a dispute arose as to the right of precedency in taking
the door and the head of the table.&nbsp; This waxed very serious and
threatened to break up these annual gatherings.&nbsp; But the wisdom
and virtue of John prevented this rupture.&nbsp; He made a touching
speech to them, soothing their angry spirits with an appeal to the common
and precious memories of their native land and to all their joint experiences
in this.&nbsp; He entreated them to return to their homes quietly, and
he would remedy the current difficulty at the next meeting.&nbsp; Won
by his kindly spirit and words, they complied with his request.&nbsp;
In the interval, John built a house expressly for the purpose, of an
octagonal form, with eight doors and windows.&nbsp; He then placed a
table of oak, of the same shape, in the middle; and when the next meeting
took place, he desired each head of the different Groat families to
enter at his own door and sit at the head of his own table.&nbsp; This
happy and ingenious plan restored good feeling and a pleasant footing
to the sensitive families, and gave to the good Dutchman&rsquo;s name
an interest which it will carry with it forever.</p>
<p>After filling my pockets with some beautiful little shells strewing
the site of the building, called &ldquo;John O&rsquo;Groat&rsquo;s buckies,&rdquo;
I returned to the inn.&nbsp; One of the gentlemen who accompanied me
was the tenant of the farm which must have been John&rsquo;s homestead,
containing about two hundred acres.&nbsp; It was mostly in oats, still
standing, with a good promise of forty bushels to the acre.&nbsp; He
resided at Thurso, some twenty miles distant, and found no difficulty
in carrying on the estate through a hired foreman.&nbsp; I never passed
a more enjoyable evening than in the little, cozy, low-jointed parlor
of this sea-side inn.&nbsp; Scotch cakes never had such a relish for
me nor a peat-fire more comfortable fellowship of pleasant fancies,
as I sat at the tea-table.&nbsp; There was a moaning of winds down the
Pentland Firth&mdash;a clattering and chattering of window shutters,
as if the unrestful spirits of the old Vikings and Norse heroes were
walking up and down the scene of their wild histories and gibbering
over their feats and fates.&nbsp; Spent an hour or two in writing letters
to friends in England and America, to tell them of my arrival at this
extreme goal of my walk, and a full hour in poring over the visitors&rsquo;
book, in which there were names from all countries in Christendom, and
also impressions and observations in prose, poetry, English, French,
Latin, German and other languages.&nbsp; Many of the comments thus recorded
intimated some dissatisfaction that John O&rsquo;Groat&rsquo;s House
was so <i>mythical</i>; that so much had to be supplied by the imagination;
that not even a stone of the foundation remained in its place to assist
fancy to erect the building into a positive fact of history.&nbsp; But
they all bore full and sometimes fervid testimony to the good cheer
of the inn at the hands of the landlady.&nbsp; There was one record
which blended loyalty to palate and patriotism&mdash;&ldquo;The Roast
Beef of Old England&rdquo; and &ldquo;God save the Queen&rdquo;&mdash;rather
amusingly.&nbsp; A party wrote their impressions after this manner&mdash;&ldquo;Visited
John O&rsquo;Groat&rsquo;s House; found little to see; came back tired
and hungry; walked into a couple of tender chickens and a good piece
of bacon: God save Mrs. Manson and all the Royal Family!&rdquo;&nbsp;
This concluding &ldquo;sentiment&rdquo; was doubtless sincere and honest,
although it involved a question of precedence in the rank of two feelings
which John the Dutchman could have hardly settled by his eight-angled
plan of adjustment.</p>
<p>The next morning, for the first time for nearly three months of continuous
travel, I faced southward, leaving behind me the Orkneys unvisited,
though I had a strong desire to see those celebrated islands&mdash;the
theatre of so much interesting history.&nbsp; Twenty years ago I translated
all the &ldquo;<i>Sagas</i>&rdquo; relating to the voyages and exploits
of the Northmen in these northern seas and islands, their explorations
of the coast of North America centuries before Columbus was born, their
doings in Iceland and on all the islands great and small now forming
the British realms.&nbsp; This gave an additional zest to my enjoyment
in standing on the shore of the Pentland Firth and looking over upon
the scene of old Haco&rsquo;s and Sigurd&rsquo;s doing, daring and dying.</p>
<p>Footed it back to Wick, and there terminated my walk, having measured,
step by step, full seven hundred miles since I left London, counting
in the divergences from a straight line which I had made.&nbsp; In the
evening I addressed a large and intelligent audience which had been
convened at short notice, and I never stood up before one with such
peculiar satisfaction as in that North-star town of Scotland.&nbsp;
I had travelled nearly the whole distance <i>incog</i>., without hearing
my own name on a pair of human lips for weeks.&nbsp; To lay aside this
embargo and to speak to such a large congregation, face to face, was
like coming back again into the great communions of humanity after a
long and private fellowship with the secluded quietudes of Nature.</p>
<p>At four p.m. the next day, I took the Thurso coach and passed over
in the night the whole distance that had occupied me a week in travelling
by staff.&nbsp; Stopped a night in Inverness, another at Elgin, and
spent the Sabbath with my friend, Anthony Cruickshank, at Sittyton,
about fifteen miles north of Aberdeen.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX.</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p><i>ANTHONY CRUICKSHANK&mdash;THE GREATEST HERD OF SHORTHORNS IN THE
WORLD&mdash;RETURN TO LONDON AND TERMINATION OF MY TOUR.</i></p>
<p>Sittyton designates hardly a village in Aberdeenshire, but it has
become a point of great interest to the agricultural world&mdash;a second
Babraham.&nbsp; In this quiet, rural district, Anthony Cruickshank,
a quiet, modest, meek-voiced member of the Society of Friends, &ldquo;generally
called Quakers,&rdquo; has made a history and a great enterprise of
vast value to the world.&nbsp; He is one of those four-handed but one-minded
men who, with a pair to each, build up simultaneously two great businesses
so symmetrically that you would think they gave their whole intellect,
will and genius to one.&nbsp; Anthony Cruickshank, the Quaker of Sittyton,
has made but little more noise in the world than Nature makes in building
up some of her great and beautiful structures.&nbsp; His footsteps were
so light and gentle that few knew that he was running at all, until
they saw him lead the racers by a head at the end of the course.&nbsp;
The world is wide, and dews of every temperature fall upon its meadow
and pasture lands.&nbsp; Vast regions are fresh and green all the year
round, yielding food for cattle seemingly in the best conditions created
for their growth and perfection.&nbsp; The highest nobility and gentry
of this and other countries are giving to the living statuary of these
animals that science, taste and genius which the most enthusiastic artists
are giving to the still but speaking statuary of the canvas.&nbsp; The
competition in this cultivation of animal life is wide and eager, and
spreading fast over Christendom; emperors, kings, princes, dukes and
belted barons are on the lists.&nbsp; Antipodean agriculturists meet
in the great international <i>concours</i> of cattle, horses, sheep
and swine.&nbsp; Never was royal blood or the inheritance of a crown
threaded through divergent veins to its source with more care and pride
than the lineage of these four-footed &ldquo;princes&rdquo; and &ldquo;princesses,&rdquo;
&ldquo;dukes&rdquo; and &ldquo;duchesses,&rdquo; and &ldquo;knights&rdquo;
and &ldquo;ladies&rdquo; of the stable and pasture.&nbsp; No peerage
ever kept a more jealous heraldry than the herd-book of this great quadruped
<i>noblesse</i>.&nbsp; The world, by consent, has crowned the Shorthorn
Durham as the best blood that ever a horned animal carried in its veins.&nbsp;
Princely connoisseurs and amateurs, and all the dilettanti as well as
practical agriculturists of Christendom, are giving more thought to
the perfection and perpetuation of this blood than to any other name
and breed.&nbsp; Still&mdash;and this distinction is crowned with double
merit by the fact&mdash;Anthony Cruickshank, draper of Aberdeen, has
worked his way, gradually and noiselessly, to the very head and front
of the Shorthorn knighthood of the world.&nbsp; While pursuing the occupation
to which he was bred with as much assiduity and success as if it had
every thought and activity which a man should give to a business, he
built up, at a considerable distance from his warehouse, an enterprise
of an entirely different nature, to a magnitude which no other man has
ever equalled.&nbsp; He now owns the largest herd of Shorthorns in the
world, breeding and feeding them to the highest perfection in the cold
and naturally unfertile county of Aberdeen, which no man of less patience
and perseverance would select as the ground on which to enter the lists
against such an array of competitors in Great Britain and other countries.&nbsp;
I regret that my Notes have already expanded to such a volume as to
preclude a more extended account of his operations in this great field
of usefulness.&nbsp; A few simple facts will suffice to give the reader
an approximate idea of what he has done in this department.</p>
<p>About the year 1825, young Cruickshank was put to a Friends&rsquo;
school in Cumberland.&nbsp; He was a farmer&rsquo;s son, and seems to
have conceived a great fancy for cattle from childhood.&nbsp; A gentleman
resided not far from the school, who was an owner and amateur of Shorthorns,
and Anthony would frequently spend his half-holidays with him, inspecting
and admiring his herd, and asking him questions about their qualities
and his way of treating them.&nbsp; From this school he was sent as
an apprentice to a trading establishment in Edinburgh, and at the end
of his term set up business for himself as a draper in Aberdeen.&nbsp;
All through this period he carried with him his first interest in cattle-culture,
but was unable to make a beginning in it until 1837, when he purchased
a single Shorthorn cow in the county of Durham, and soon afterward two
other animals of the same blood.&nbsp; These constituted the nucleus
of his herd at Sittyton.&nbsp; One by one he added other animals of
the same stock, purchased in different parts of England, Ireland and
Scotland.&nbsp; With these accessions by purchase, and from natural
increase, his herd grew rapidly and prospered finely, so that he was
obliged to add field to field and farm to farm to produce feed for such
a number of mouths.&nbsp; In a few years he reached his present maximum
which he does not wish to exceed.&nbsp; That is, his herd now averages
annually three hundred head of this noble and beautiful race of animals,
or the largest number of them owned by any one man in the world.&nbsp;
In 1841, he announced his first sale of young bulls, and every year
since that date has put up at public auction the male progeny of the
herd.&nbsp; These sales usually take place in the first week of October,
and are attended by from 300 to 500 persons from all parts of the kingdom.&nbsp;
After carefully inspecting the various lots, they adjourn to a substantial
luncheon at twelve o&rsquo;clock, and at one p.m. they repair to the
sale ring and the bidding begins in good earnest, and the auctioneer&rsquo;s
hammer falls quick and often, averaging about a minute and a half to
each lot.&nbsp; Thus the forty lots of young bulls from six to ten months
old are passed away, averaging from 33 to 44 guineas each.&nbsp; Besides
these, from fifty to sixty young bulls, cows and heifers are disposed
of by private sale during the season, ranging from 50 to 150 guineas,
going to buyers from all parts of the world.</p>
<p>It is Mr. Cruickshank&rsquo;s well-matured opinion, resulting from
long experience and observation, that there is no breed of cattle so
easily maintained in good condition as the Shorthorns.&nbsp; His are
fed on pasture grass from the 1st of May to the middle of October, lying
in the open field night and day.&nbsp; In the winter they are fed <i>entirely
on oat-straw and turnips</i>.&nbsp; Not a handful of hay or of meal
is given them.&nbsp; The calves are allowed to suck their dams at pleasure.&nbsp;
He is convinced that with this simple system of feeding, together with
the bracing air of Aberdeenshire, he has obtained a tribe of animals
of hardy and robust constitutions, of early maturity, well calculated
to improve the general stock of the country.</p>
<p>It was to me a delight to see this, the greatest herd of Shorthorns
in the world, numbering animals of apparently the highest perfection
to which they could attain under human treatment.&nbsp; What a court
and coterie of &ldquo;princes,&rdquo; &ldquo;dukes,&rdquo; &ldquo;knights&rdquo;
and &ldquo;ladies&rdquo; those stables contained&mdash;creatures that
would not have dishonored higher names by wearing them!&nbsp; I was
pleased to find that Republics and their less pretentious titles were
not excluded from the goodly fellowship of this short-horned aristocracy.&nbsp;
There was one grand and noble bull called &ldquo;President Lincoln,&rdquo;
not only, I fancy, out of respect to &ldquo;Honest Old Abe,&rdquo; but
also in reference to the disposition and capacities of the animal.&nbsp;
Truly, if let loose in some of our New England fields, he would prove
himself a tremendous &ldquo;railsplitter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After spending a quiet Sabbath with this old friend and host at his
farm-house at Sittyton, I took the train for Edinburgh and had a week
of the liveliest enjoyment in that city, attending the meetings of the
Social Science Congress.&nbsp; There I saw and heard for the first time
the venerable Lord Brougham, also men and women of less reputation,
but of equal heart and will to serve their kind and country.&nbsp; I
had intended to make a separate chapter on these meetings and another
on the re-unions of the British Association at Newcastle-upon-Tyne,
but the space to which this volume must be limited precludes any notice
of these most interesting and important gatherings.&nbsp; Stopping at
different points on the way, I reached London about the middle of October,
having occupied just four months in my northern tour; bringing back
a heartful of sunny memories of what I had seen and enjoyed.</p>

(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
